It is not intended as a substitute for the printed original but rather as a searchable supplement. My e-texts may prove convenient substitutes for hard-to-get works in a course where both instructor and students accept the possibility of some imperfections in the text, but if you are writing a scholarly article, dissertation, or book, you should use the standard hard-copy editions of any works you cite. Pagination and Paragraphing: To avoid an unwieldy electronic copy, I have transferred original pagination to brackets. A bracketed numeral such as [22] indicates that the material immediately following the number marks the beginning of the relevant page. I have preserved paragraph structure except for first-line indentation. Hyphenation: I have not preserved original hyphenation since an e- text does not require line-end or page-end hyphenation. Greek typeface: For this full-text edition, I have transliterated Pater's Greek quotations.

SHADWELL [1] THE present volume consists of a collection of essays by the late Mr. Pater, all of which have already been given to the public in various Magazines; and it is owing to the kindness of the several proprietors of those Magazines that they can now be brought together in a collected shape. It will, it is believed, be felt, that their value is considerably enhanced by their appearance in a single volume, where they can throw light upon one another, and exhibit by their connexion a more complete view of the scope and purpose of Mr. Pater in dealing with the art and literature of the ancient world. The essays fall into two distinct groups, one dealing with the subjects of Greek mythology and Greek poetry, the other with the history of Greek sculpture and Greek architecture. But these two groups are not wholly distinct; they mutually illustrate one another, and serve to enforce Mr. Pater's conception of the essential [2] unity, in all its many-sidedness, of the Greek character. The god understood as the \"spiritual form\" of the things of nature is not only the key-note of the \"Study of Dionysus\"* and \"The Myth of Demeter and Persephone,\"* but reappears as contributing to the interpretation of the growth of Greek sculpture.* Thus, though in the bibliography of his writings, the two groups are separated by a considerable interval, there is no change of view; he had already reached the centre of the problem, and, the secret once gained, his mode of treatment of the different aspects of Greek life and thought is permanent and consistent. The essay on \"The Myth of Demeter and Persephone\" was originally prepared as two lectures, for delivery, in 1875, at the Birmingham and Midland Institute. These lectures were published in the Fortnightly Review, in Jan. and Feb. 1876. The \"Study of Dionysus\" appeared in the same Review in Dec. 1876. \"The Bacchanals of Euripides\" must have been written about the same time, as a sequel to the \"Study of Dionysus\"; for, in 1878, Mr. Pater revised the four essays, with the intention, apparently, of publishing them collectively in a volume, an intention afterwards abandoned. [3] The text now printed has, except that of \"The Bacchanals,\" been taken from proofs then set up, further corrected in manuscript. \"The Bacchanals,\" written long before, was not published until 1889, when it appeared in Macmillan's Magazine for May. It was reprinted, without alteration, prefixed to Dr. Tyrrell's edition of the Bacchae. \"Hippolytus Veiled\" first appeared in August 1889, in Macmillan's Magazine. It was afterwards rewritten, but with only a few substantial alterations, in Mr. Pater's own hand, with a view, probably, of republishing it with other essays. This last revise has been followed in the text now printed. The papers on Greek sculpture* are all that remain of a series which, if Mr. Pater had lived, would, probably, have grown into a still more important work. Such a work would have included one or more essays on Phidias and the Parthenon, of which only a fragment, though an important fragment, can be found amongst his papers; and it was to have been prefaced by an Introduction to Greek Studies, only a page or two of which was ever written. [4] This is not the place to speak of Mr. Pater's private virtues, the personal charm of his character, the brightness of his talk, the warmth of his friendship, the devotion of his family life. But a few words may be permitted on the value of the work by which he will be known to those who never saw him. Persons only superficially acquainted, or by hearsay, with his writings, are apt to sum up his merits as a writer by saying that he was a master, or a consummate master of style; but those who have really studied what he wrote do not need to be told that his distinction does not lie in his literary grace alone, his fastidious choice of language, his power of word-painting, but in the depth and seriousness of his studies. That the amount he has produced, in a literary life of thirty years, is not greater, is one proof among many of the spirit in which he worked. His genius was \"an infinite capacity for taking pains.\" That delicacy of insight, that gift of penetrating into the heart of things, that subtleness of interpretation, which with him seems an instinct, is the outcome of hard, patient, conscientious study. If he had chosen, he might, without difficulty, have produced a far greater body of work of less value; and from a worldly point of view, he would have been wise. Such was not his understanding [5] of the use of his talents. Cui multum datum est, multum quaeretur ab eo. Those who wish to understand the spirit in which he worked, will find it in this volume.

A STUDY OF DIONYSUS: THE SPIRITUAL FORM OF FIRE AND DEW [9] WRITERS on mythology speak habitually of the religion of the Greeks. In thus speaking, they are really using a misleading expression, and should speak rather of religions; each race and class of Greeks--the Dorians, the people of the coast, the fishers--having had a religion of its own, conceived of the objects that came nearest to it and were most in its thoughts, and the resulting usages and ideas never having come to have a precisely harmonised system, after the analogy of some other religions. The religion of Dionysus is the religion of people who pass their lives among the vines. As the religion of Demeter carries us back to the cornfields and farmsteads of Greece, and places us, in fancy, among a primitive race, in the furrow and beside the granary; so the religion of Dionysus carries us back to its vineyards, and is a monument of the ways and thoughts of people whose days go by beside the winepress, and [10] under the green and purple shadows, and whose material happiness depends on the crop of grapes. For them the thought of Dionysus and his circle, a little Olympus outside the greater, covered the whole of life, and was a complete religion, a sacred representation or interpretation of the whole human experience, modified by the special limitations, the special privileges of insight or suggestion, incident to their peculiar mode of existence. Now, if the reader wishes to understand what the scope of the religion of Dionysus was to the Greeks who lived in it, all it represented to them by way of one clearly conceived yet complex symbol, let him reflect what the loss would be if all the effect and expression drawn from the imagery of the vine and the cup fell out of the whole body of existing poetry; how many fascinating trains of reflexion, what colour and substance would therewith have been deducted from it, filled as it is, apart from the more aweful associations of the Christian ritual, apart from Galahad's cup, with all the various symbolism of the fruit of the vine. That supposed loss is but an imperfect measure of all that the name of Dionysus recalled to the Greek mind, under a single imaginable form, an outward body of flesh presented to the senses, and comprehending, as its animating soul, a whole world of thoughts, surmises, greater and less experiences. [11] The student of the comparative science of religions finds in the religion of Dionysus one of many modes of that primitive tree-worship which, growing out of some universal instinctive belief that trees and flowers are indeed habitations of living spirits, is found almost everywhere in the earlier stages of civilisation, enshrined in legend or custom, often graceful enough, as if the delicate beauty of the object of worship had effectually taken hold on the fancy of the worshipper. Shelley's Sensitive Plant shows in what mists of poetical reverie such feeling may still float about a mind full of modern lights, the feeling we too have of a life in the green world, always ready to assert its claim over our sympathetic fancies. Who has not at moments felt the scruple, which is with us always regarding animal life, following the signs of animation further still, till one almost hesitates to pluck out the little soul of flower or leaf? And in so graceful a faith the Greeks had their share; what was crude and inane in it becoming, in the atmosphere of their energetic, imaginative intelligence, refined and humanised. The oak-grove of Dodona, the seat of their most venerable oracle, did but perpetuate the fancy that the sounds of the wind in the trees may be, for certain prepared and chosen ears, intelligible voices; they could believe in the transmigration of souls into mulberry and laurel, mint and hyacinth; and the dainty Metamorphoses of Ovid [12] are but a fossilised form of one morsel here and there, from a whole world of transformation, with which their nimble fancy was perpetually playing. \"Together with them,\" says the Homeric hymn to Aphrodite, of the Hamadryads, the nymphs which animate the forest trees, \"with them, at the moment of their birth, grew up out of the soil, oak-tree or pine, fair, flourishing among the mountains. And when at last the appointed hour of their death has come, first of all, those fair trees are dried up; the bark perishes from around them, and the branches fall away; and therewith the soul of them deserts the light of the sun.\"+ These then are the nurses of the vine, bracing it with interchange of sun and shade. They bathe, they dance, they sing songs of enchantment, so that those who seem oddly in love with nature, and strange among their fellows, are still said to be nympholepti; above all, they are weavers or spinsters, spinning or weaving with airiest fingers, and subtlest, many-coloured threads, the foliage of the trees, the petals of flowers, the skins of the fruit, the long thin stalks on which the poplar leaves are set so lightly that Homer compares to them, in their constant motion, the maids who sit spinning in the house of Alcinous. The nymphs of Naxos, where the grape-skin is darkest, weave for him a purple robe. Only, the ivy is never transformed, is visible as natural ivy to the last, pressing the [13] dark outline of its leaves close upon the firm, white, quite human flesh of the god's forehead. In its earliest form, then, the religion of Dionysus presents us with the most graceful phase of this graceful worship, occupying a place between the ruder fancies of half-civilised people concerning life in flower or tree, and the dreamy after-fancies of the poet of the Sensitive Plant. He is the soul of the individual vine, first; the young vine at the house-door of the newly married, for instance, as the vine-grower stoops over it, coaxing and nursing it, like a pet animal or a little child; afterwards, the soul of the whole species, the spirit of fire and dew, alive and leaping in a thousand vines, as the higher intelligence, brooding more deeply over things, pursues, in thought, the generation of sweetness and strength in the veins of the tree, the transformation of water into wine, little by little; noting all the influences upon it of the heaven above and the earth beneath; and shadowing forth, in each pause of the process, an intervening person--what is to us but the secret chemistry of nature being to them the mediation of living spirits. So they passed on to think of Dionysus (naming him at last from the brightness of the sky and the moisture of the earth) not merely as the soul of the vine, but of all that life in flowing things of which the vine is the symbol, because its most emphatic example. At Delos he bears a son, from whom [14] in turn spring the three mysterious sisters Oeno, Spermo, and Elais, who, dwelling in the island, exercise respectively the gifts of turning all things at will into oil, and corn, and wine. In the Bacchae of Euripides, he gives his followers, by miracle, honey and milk, and the water gushes for them from the smitten rock. He comes at last to have a scope equal to that of Demeter, a realm as wide and mysterious as hers; the whole productive power of the earth is in him, and the explanation of its annual change. As some embody their intuitions of that power in corn, so others in wine. He is the dispenser of the earth's hidden wealth, giver of riches through the vine, as Demeter through the grain. And as Demeter sends the airy, dainty-wheeled and dainty-winged spirit of Triptolemus to bear her gifts abroad on all winds, so Dionysus goes on his eastern journey, with its many intricate adventures, on which he carries his gifts to every people. A little Olympus outside the greater, I said, of Dionysus and his companions; he is the centre of a cycle, the hierarchy of the creatures of water and sunlight in many degrees; and that fantastic system of tree-worship places round him, not the fondly whispering spirits of the more graceful inhabitants of woodland only, the nymphs of the poplar and the pine, but the whole satyr circle, intervening between the headship of the vine and the mere earth, the grosser, less human [15] spirits, incorporate and made visible, of the more coarse and sluggish sorts of vegetable strength, the fig, the reed, the ineradicable weed-things which will attach themselves, climbing about the vine-poles, or seeking the sun between the hot stones. For as Dionysus, the spiritual form of the vine, is of the highest human type, so the fig-tree and the reed have animal souls, mistakeable in the thoughts of a later, imperfectly remembering age, for mere abstractions of animal nature; Snubnose, and Sweetwine, and Silenus, the oldest of them all, so old that he has come to have the gift of prophecy. Quite different from them in origin and intent, but confused with them in form, are those other companions of Dionysus, Pan and his children. Home-spun dream of simple people, and like them in the uneventful tenour of his existence, he has almost no story; he is but a presence; the spiritual form of Arcadia, and the ways of human life there; the reflexion, in sacred image or ideal, of its flocks, and orchards, and wild honey; the dangers of its hunters; its weariness in noonday heat; its children, agile as the goats they tend, who run, in their picturesque rags, across the solitary wanderer's path, to startle him, in the unfamiliar upper places; its one adornment and solace being the dance to the homely shepherd's pipe, cut by Pan first from the sedges of the brook Molpeia. Breathing of remote nature, the sense of which [16] is so profound in the Homeric hymn to Pan, the pines, the foldings of the hills, the leaping streams, the strange echoings and dying of sound on the heights, \"the bird, which among the petals of many-flowered spring, pouring out a dirge, sends forth her honey-voiced song,\" \"the crocus and the hyacinth disorderly mixed in the deep grass\"+--things which the religion of Dionysus loves--Pan joins the company of the Satyrs. Amongst them, they give their names to insolence and mockery, and the finer sorts of malice, to unmeaning and ridiculous fear. But the best spirits have found in them also a certain human pathos, as in displaced beings, coming even nearer to most men, in their very roughness, than the noble and delicate person of the vine; dubious creatures, half-way between the animal and human kinds, speculating wistfully on their being, because not wholly understanding themselves and their place in nature; as the animals seem always to have this expression to some noticeable degree in the presence of man. In the later school of Attic sculpture they are treated with more and more of refinement, till in some happy moment Praxiteles conceived a model, often repeated, which concentrates this sentiment of true humour concerning them; a model of dainty natural ease in posture, but with the legs slightly crossed, as only lowly-bred gods are used to carry them, and with some puzzled trouble of youth, you might wish for a moment [17] to smoothe away, puckering the forehead a little, between the pointed ears, on which the goodly hair of his animal strength grows low. Little by little, the signs of brute nature are subordinated, or disappear; and at last, Robetta, a humble Italian engraver of the fifteenth century, entering into the Greek fancy because it belongs to all ages, has expressed it in its most exquisite form, in a design of Ceres and her children, of whom their mother is no longer afraid, as in the Homeric hymn to Pan. The puck- noses have grown delicate, so that, with Plato's infatuated lover, you may call them winsome, if you please; and no one would wish those hairy little shanks away, with which one of the small Pans walks at her side, grasping her skirt stoutly; while the other, the sick or weary one, rides in the arms of Ceres herself, who in graceful Italian dress, and decked airily with fruit and corn, steps across a country of cut sheaves, pressing it closely to her, with a child's peevish trouble in its face, and its small goat-legs and tiny hoofs folded over together, precisely after the manner of a little child. There is one element in the conception of Dionysus, which his connexion with the satyrs, Marsyas being one of them, and with Pan, from whom the flute passed to all the shepherds of Theocritus, alike illustrates, his interest, namely, in one of the great species of music. One form of that wilder vegetation, of which the Satyr race is the soul made visible, is the reed, which [18] the creature plucks and trims into musical pipes. And as Apollo inspires and rules over all the music of strings, so Dionysus inspires and rules over all the music of the reed, the water-plant, in which the ideas of water and of vegetable life are brought close together, natural property, therefore, of the spirit of life in the green sap. I said that the religion of Dionysus was, for those who lived in it, a complete religion, a complete sacred representation and interpretation of the whole of life; and as, in his relation to the vine, he fills for them the place of Demeter, is the life of the earth through the grape as she through the grain, so, in this other phase of his being, in his relation to the reed, he fills for them the place of Apollo; he is the inherent cause of music and poetry; he inspires; he explains the phenomena of enthusiasm, as distinguished by Plato in the Phaedrus, the secrets of possession by a higher and more energetic spirit than one's own, the gift of self-revelation, of passing out of oneself through words, tones, gestures. A winged Dionysus, venerated at Amyclae, was perhaps meant to represent him thus, as the god of enthusiasm, of the rising up on those spiritual wings, of which also we hear something in the Phaedrus of Plato. The artists of the Renaissance occupied themselves much with the person and the story of Dionysus; and Michelangelo, in a work still remaining in Florence, in which he essayed [19] with success to produce a thing which should pass with the critics for a piece of ancient sculpture, has represented him in the fulness, as it seems, of this enthusiasm, an image of delighted, entire surrender to transporting dreams. And this is no subtle after-thought of a later age, but true to certain finer movements of old Greek sentiment, though it may seem to have waited for the hand of Michelangelo before it attained complete realisation. The head of Ion leans, as they recline at the banquet, on the shoulder of Charmides; he mutters in his sleep of things seen therein, but awakes as the flute-players enter, whom Charmides has hired for his birthday supper. The soul of Callias, who sits on the other side of Charmides, flashes out; he counterfeits, with life-like gesture, the personal tricks of friend or foe; or the things he could never utter before, he finds words for now; the secrets of life are on his lips. It is in this loosening of the lips and heart, strictly, that Dionysus is the Deliverer, Eleutherios; and of such enthusiasm, or ecstasy, is, in a certain sense, an older patron than Apollo himself. Even at Delphi, the centre of Greek inspiration and of the religion of Apollo, his claim always maintained itself; and signs are not wanting that Apollo was but a later comer there. There, under his later reign, hard by the golden image of Apollo himself, near the sacred tripod on which the Pythia sat to prophesy, was to be seen a strange object--a sort [20] of coffin or cinerary urn with the inscription, \"Here lieth the body of Dionysus, the son of Semele.\" The pediment of the great temple was divided between them--Apollo with the nine Muses on that side, Dionysus, with perhaps three times three Graces, on this. A third of the whole year was held sacred to him; the four winter months were the months of Dionysus; and in the shrine of Apollo itself he was worshipped with almost equal devotion. The religion of Dionysus takes us back, then, into that old Greek life of the vineyards, as we see it on many painted vases, with much there as we should find it now, as we see it in Bennozzo Gozzoli's mediaeval fresco of the Invention of Wine in the Campo Santo at Pisa- -the family of Noah presented among all the circumstances of a Tuscan vineyard, around the press from which the first wine is flowing, a painted idyll, with its vintage colours still opulent in decay, and not without its solemn touch of biblical symbolism. For differences, we detect in that primitive life, and under that Greek sky, a nimbler play of fancy, lightly and unsuspiciously investing all things with personal aspect and incident, and a certain mystical apprehension, now almost departed, of unseen powers beyond the material veil of things, corresponding to the exceptional vigour and variety of the Greek organisation. This peasant life lies, in unhistoric time, behind the definite forms with which poetry and a refined [21] priesthood afterwards clothed the religion of Dionysus; and the mere scenery and circumstances of the vineyard have determined many things in its development. The noise of the vineyard still sounds in some of his epithets, perhaps in his best-known name--Iacchus, Bacchus. The masks suspended on base or cornice, so familiar an ornament in later Greek architecture, are the little faces hanging from the vines, and moving in the wind, to scare the birds. That garland of ivy, the aesthetic value of which is so great in the later imagery of Dionysus and his descendants, the leaves of which, floating from his hair, become so noble in the hands of Titian and Tintoret, was actually worn on the head for coolness; his earliest and most sacred images were wrought in the wood of the vine. The people of the vineyard had their feast, the little or country Dionysia, which still lived on, side by side with the greater ceremonies of a later time, celebrated in December, the time of the storing of the new wine. It was then that the potters' fair came, calpis and amphora, together with lamps against the winter, laid out in order for the choice of buyers; for Keramus, the Greek Vase, is a son of Dionysus, of wine and of Athene, who teaches men all serviceable and decorative art. Then the goat was killed, and its blood poured out at the root of the vines; and Dionysus literally drank the blood of goats; and, being Greeks, with quick and mobile sympathies, [22] deisidaimones,+ \"superstitious,\" or rather \"susceptible of religious impressions,\" some among them, remembering those departed since last year, add yet a little more, and a little wine and water for the dead also; brooding how the sense of these things might pass below the roots, to spirits hungry and thirsty, perhaps, in their shadowy homes. But the gaiety, that gaiety which Aristophanes in the Acharnians has depicted with so many vivid touches, as a thing of which civil war had deprived the villages of Attica, preponderates over the grave. The travelling country show comes round with its puppets; even the slaves have their holiday;* the mirth becomes excessive; they hide their faces under grotesque masks of bark, or stain them with wine-lees, or potters' crimson even, like the old rude idols painted red; and carry in midnight procession such rough symbols of the productive force of nature as the women and children had best not look upon; which will be frowned upon, and refine themselves, or disappear, in the feasts of cultivated Athens. Of the whole story of Dionysus, it was the episode of his marriage with Ariadne about which ancient art concerned itself oftenest, and with most effect. Here, although the antiquarian [23] may still detect circumstances which link the persons and incidents of the legend with the mystical life of the earth, as symbols of its annual change, yet the merely human interest of the story has prevailed over its earlier significance; the spiritual form of fire and dew has become a romantic lover. And as a story of romantic love, fullest perhaps of all the motives of classic legend of the pride of life, it survived with undiminished interest to a later world, two of the greatest masters of Italian painting having poured their whole power into it; Titian with greater space of ingathered shore and mountain, and solemn foliage, and fiery animal life; Tintoret with profounder luxury of delight in the nearness to each other, and imminent embrace, of glorious bodily presences; and both alike with consummate beauty of physical form. Hardly less humanised is the Theban legend of Dionysus, the legend of his birth from Semele, which, out of the entire body of tradition concerning him, was accepted as central by the Athenian imagination. For the people of Attica, he comes from Boeotia, a country of northern marsh and mist, but from whose sombre, black marble towns came also the vine, the musical reed cut from its sedges, and the worship of the Graces, always so closely connected with the religion of Dionysus. \"At Thebes alone,\" says Sophocles, \"mortal women bear immortal gods.\" His mother is the daughter of Cadmus, himself marked out by [24] many curious circumstances as the close kinsman of the earth, to which he all but returns at last, as the serpent, in his old age, attesting some closer sense lingering there of the affinity of man with the dust from whence he came. Semele, an old Greek word, as it seems, for the surface of the earth, the daughter of Cadmus, beloved by Zeus, desires to see her lover in the glory with which he is seen by the immortal Hera. He appears to her in lightning. But the mortal may not behold him and live. Semele gives premature birth to the child Dionysus; whom, to preserve it from the jealousy of Hera, Zeus hides in a part of his thigh, the child returning into the loins of its father, whence in due time it is born again. Yet in this fantastic story, hardly less than in the legend of Ariadne, the story of Dionysus has become a story of human persons, with human fortunes, and even more intimately human appeal to sympathy; so that Euripides, pre-eminent as a poet of pathos, finds in it a subject altogether to his mind. All the interest now turns on the development of its points of moral or sentimental significance; the love of the immortal for the mortal, the presumption of the daughter of man who desires to see the divine form as it is; on the fact that not without loss of sight, or life itself, can man look upon it. The travail of nature has been transformed into the pangs of the human mother; and the poet dwells much on the pathetic incident of death in childbirth, making [25] Dionysus, as Callimachus calls him, a seven months' child, cast out among its enemies, motherless. And as a consequence of this human interest, the legend attaches itself, as in an actual history, to definite sacred objects and places, the venerable relic of the wooden image which fell into the chamber of Semele with the lightning-flash, and which the piety of a later age covered with plates of brass; the Ivy- Fountain near Thebes, the water of which was so wonderfully bright and sweet to drink, where the nymphs bathed the new-born child; the grave of Semele, in a sacred enclosure grown with ancient vines, where some volcanic heat or flame was perhaps actually traceable, near the lightning-struck ruins of her supposed abode. Yet, though the mystical body of the earth is forgotten in the human anguish of the mother of Dionysus, the sense of his essence of fire and dew still lingers in his most sacred name, as the son of Semele, Dithyrambus. We speak of a certain wild music in words or rhythm as dithyrambic, like the dithyrambus, that is, the wild choral-singing of the worshippers of Dionysus. But Dithyrambus seems to have been, in the first instance, the name, not of the hymn, but of the god to whom the hymn is sung; and, through a tangle of curious etymological speculations as to the precise derivation of this name, one thing seems clearly visible, that it commemorates, namely, the double birth of the vine-god; that [26] he is born once and again; his birth, first of fire, and afterwards of dew; the two dangers that beset him; his victory over two enemies, the capricious, excessive heats and colds of spring. He is pyrigenês,+ then, fire-born, the son of lightning; lightning being to light, as regards concentration, what wine is to the other strengths of the earth. And who that has rested a hand on the glittering silex of a vineyard slope in August, where the pale globes of sweetness are lying, does not feel this? It is out of the bitter salts of a smitten, volcanic soil that it comes up with the most curious virtues. The mother faints and is parched up by the heat which brings the child to the birth; and it pierces through, a wonder of freshness, drawing its everlasting green and typical coolness out of the midst of the ashes; its own stem becoming at last like a tangled mass of tortured metal. In thinking of Dionysus, then, as fire-born, the Greeks apprehend and embody the sentiment, the poetry, of all tender things which grow out of a hard soil, or in any sense blossom before the leaf, like the little mezereon-plant of English gardens, with its pale-purple, wine-scented flowers upon the leafless twigs in February, or like the almond-trees of Tuscany, or Aaron's rod that budded, or the staff in the hand of the Pope when Tannhäuser's repentance is accepted. And his second birth is of the dew. The fire of which he was born would destroy him in [27] his turn, as it withered up his mother; a second danger comes; from this the plant is protected by the influence of the cooling cloud, the lower part of his father the sky, in which it is wrapped and hidden, and of which it is born again, its second mother being, in some versions of the legend, Hyé--the Dew. The nursery, where Zeus places it to be brought up, is a cave in Mount Nysa, sought by a misdirected ingenuity in many lands, but really, like the place of the carrying away of Persephone, a place of fantasy, the oozy place of springs in the hollow of the hillside, nowhere and everywhere, where the vine was \"invented.\" The nymphs of the trees overshadow it from above; the nymphs of the springs sustain it from below--the Hyades, those first leaping maenads, who, as the springs become rain-clouds, go up to heaven among the stars, and descend again, as dew or shower, upon it; so that the religion of Dionysus connects itself, not with tree-worship only, but also with ancient water-worship, the worship of the spiritual forms of springs and streams. To escape from his enemies Dionysus leaps into the sea, the original of all rain and springs, whence, in early summer, the women of Elis and Argos were wont to call him, with the singing of a hymn. And again, in thus commemorating Dionysus as born of the dew, the Greeks apprehend and embody the sentiment, the poetry, of water. For not the heat only, but its solace--the freshness of the [28] cup- -this too was felt by those people of the vineyard, whom the prophet Melampus had taught to mix always their wine with water, and with whom the watering of the vines became a religious ceremony; the very dead, as they thought, drinking of and refreshed by the stream. And who that has ever felt the heat of a southern country does not know this poetry, the motive of the loveliest of all the works attributed to Giorgione, the Fête Champêtre in the Louvre; the intense sensations, the subtle and far-reaching symbolisms, which, in these places, cling about the touch and sound and sight of it? Think of the darkness of the well in the breathless court, with the delicate ring of ferns kept alive just within the opening; of the sound of the fresh water flowing through the wooden pipes into the houses of Venice, on summer mornings; of the cry Acqua frésca! at Padua or Verona, when the people run to buy what they prize, in its rare purity, more than wine, bringing pleasures so full of exquisite appeal to the imagination, that, in these streets, the very beggars, one thinks, might exhaust all the philosophy of the epicurean. Out of all these fancies comes the vine-growers' god, the spiritual form of fire and dew. Beyond the famous representations of Dionysus in later art and poetry--the Bacchanals of Euripides, the statuary of the school of Praxiteles--a multitude of literary allusions and local [29] customs carry us back to this world of vision unchecked by positive knowledge, in which the myth is begotten among a primitive people, as they wondered over the life of the thing their hands helped forward, till it became for them a kind of spirit, and their culture of it a kind of worship. Dionysus, as we see him in art and poetry, is the projected expression of the ways and dreams of this primitive people, brooded over and harmonised by the energetic Greek imagination; the religious imagination of the Greeks being, precisely, a unifying or identifying power, bringing together things naturally asunder, making, as it were, for the human body a soul of waters, for the human soul a body of flowers; welding into something like the identity of a human personality the whole range of man's experiences of a given object, or series of objects--all their outward qualities, and the visible facts regarding them--all the hidden ordinances by which those facts and qualities hold of unseen forces, and have their roots in purely visionary places. Dionysus came later than the other gods to the centres of Greek life; and, as a consequence of this, he is presented to us in an earlier stage of development than they; that element of natural fact which is the original essence of all mythology being more unmistakeably impressed upon us here than in other myths. Not the least interesting point in the study of him is, that he illustrates very clearly, not only the [30] earlier, but also a certain later influence of this element of natural fact, in the development of the gods of Greece. For the physical sense, latent in it, is the clue, not merely to the original signification of the incidents of the divine story, but also to the source of the peculiar imaginative expression which its persons subsequently retain, in the forms of the higher Greek sculpture. And this leads me to some general thoughts on the relation of Greek sculpture to mythology, which may help to explain what the function of the imagination in Greek sculpture really was, in its handling of divine persons. That Zeus is, in earliest, original, primitive intention, the open sky, across which the thunder sometimes sounds, and from which the rain descends--is a fact which not only explains the various stories related concerning him, but determines also the expression which he retained in the work of Pheidias, so far as it is possible to recall it, long after the growth of those later stories had obscured, for the minds of his worshippers, his primary signification. If men felt, as Arrian tells us, that it was a calamity to die without having seen the Zeus of Olympia; that was because they experienced the impress there of that which the eye and the whole being of man love to find above him; and the genius of Pheidias had availed to shed, upon the gold and ivory of the physical form, the blandness, the breadth, the smile of the open sky; the mild [31] heat of it still coming and going, in the face of the father of all the children of sunshine and shower; as if one of the great white clouds had composed itself into it, and looked down upon them thus, out of the midsummer noonday: so that those things might be felt as warm, and fresh, and blue, by the young and the old, the weak and the strong, who came to sun themselves in the god's presence, as procession and hymn rolled on, in the fragrant and tranquil courts of the great Olympian temple; while all the time those people consciously apprehended in the carved image of Zeus none but the personal, and really human, characteristics. Or think, again, of the Zeus of Dodona. The oracle of Dodona, with its dim grove of oaks, and sounding instruments of brass to husband the faintest whisper in the leaves, was but a great consecration of that sense of a mysterious will, of which people still feel, or seem to feel, the expression, in the motions of the wind, as it comes and goes, and which makes it, indeed, seem almost more than a mere symbol of the spirit within us. For Zeus was, indeed, the god of the winds also; Aeolus, their so-called god, being only his mortal minister, as having come, by long study of them, through signs in the fire and the like, to have a certain communicable skill regarding them, in relation to practical uses. Now, suppose a Greek sculptor to have proposed to himself to present [32] to his worshippers the image of this Zeus of Dodona, who is in the trees and on the currents of the air. Then, if he had been a really imaginative sculptor, working as Pheidias worked, the very soul of those moving, sonorous creatures would have passed through his hand, into the eyes and hair of the image; as they can actually pass into the visible expression of those who have drunk deeply of them; as we may notice, sometimes, in our walks on mountain or shore. Victory again--Niké--associated so often with Zeus--on the top of his staff, on the foot of his throne, on the palm of his extended hand-- meant originally, mythologic science tells us, only the great victory of the sky, the triumph of morning over darkness. But that physical morning of her origin has its ministry to the later aesthetic sense also. For if Niké, when she appears in company with the mortal, and wholly fleshly hero, in whose chariot she stands to guide the horses, or whom she crowns with her garland of parsley or bay, or whose names she writes on a shield, is imaginatively conceived, it is because the old skyey influences are still not quite suppressed in her clear-set eyes, and the dew of the morning still clings to her wings and her floating hair. The office of the imagination, then, in Greek sculpture, in its handling of divine persons, is thus to condense the impressions of natural things into human form; to retain that early mystical sense of water, or wind, or light, in the [33] moulding of eye and brow; to arrest it, or rather, perhaps, to set it free, there, as human expression. The body of man, indeed, was for the Greeks, still the genuine work of Prometheus; its connexion with earth and air asserted in many a legend, not shaded down, as with us, through innumerable stages of descent, but direct and immediate; in precise contrast to our physical theory of our life, which never seems to fade, dream over it as we will, out of the light of common day. The oracles with their messages to human intelligence from birds and springs of water, or vapours of the earth, were a witness to that connexion. Their story went back, as they believed, with unbroken continuity, and in the very places where their later life was lived, to a past, stretching beyond, yet continuous with, actual memory, in which heaven and earth mingled; to those who were sons and daughters of stars, and streams, and dew; to an ancestry of grander men and women, actually clothed in, or incorporate with, the qualities and influences of those objects; and we can hardly over-estimate the influence on the Greek imagination of this mythical connexion with the natural world, at not so remote a date, and of the solemnising power exercised thereby over their thoughts. In this intensely poetical situation, the historical Greeks, the Athenians of the age of Pericles, found themselves; it was as if the actual roads on which men daily walk, went up and on, into a visible wonderland. [34] With such habitual impressions concerning the body, the physical nature of man, the Greek sculptor, in his later day, still free in imagination, through the lingering influence of those early dreams, may have more easily infused into human form the sense of sun, or lightning, or cloud, to which it was so closely akin, the spiritual flesh allying itself happily to mystical meanings, and readily expressing seemingly unspeakable qualities. But the human form is a limiting influence also; and in proportion as art impressed human form, in sculpture or in the drama, on the vaguer conceptions of the Greek mind, there was danger of an escape from them of the free spirit of air, and light, and sky. Hence, all through the history of Greek art, there is a struggle, a Streben, as the Germans say, between the palpable and limited human form, and the floating essence it is to contain. On the one hand, was the teeming, still fluid world, of old beliefs, as we see it reflected in the somewhat formless theogony of Hesiod; a world, the Titanic vastness of which is congruous with a certain sublimity of speech, when he has to speak, for instance, of motion or space; as the Greek language itself has a primitive copiousness and energy of words, for wind, fire, water, cold, sound--attesting a deep susceptibility to the impressions of those things--yet with edges, most often, melting into each other. On the other hand, there was that limiting, controlling tendency, [35] identified with the Dorian influence in the history of the Greek mind, the spirit of a severe and wholly self-conscious intelligence; bent on impressing everywhere, in the products of the imagination, the definite, perfectly conceivable human form, as the only worthy subject of art; less in sympathy with the mystical genealogies of Hesiod, than with the heroes of Homer, ending in the entirely humanised religion of Apollo, the clearly understood humanity of the old Greek warriors in the marbles of Aegina. The representation of man, as he is or might be, became the aim of sculpture, and the achievement of this the subject of its whole history; one early carver had opened the eyes, another the lips, a third had given motion to the feet; in various ways, in spite of the retention of archaic idols, the genuine human expression had come, with the truthfulness of life itself. These two tendencies, then, met and struggled and were harmonised in the supreme imagination, of Pheidias, in sculpture--of Aeschylus, in the drama. Hence, a series of wondrous personalities, of which the Greek imagination became the dwelling-place; beautiful, perfectly understood human outlines, embodying a strange, delightful, lingering sense of clouds and water and sun. Such a world, the world of really imaginative Greek sculpture, we still see, reflected in many a humble vase or battered coin, in Bacchante, and Centaur, and Amazon; [36] evolved out of that \"vasty deep\"; with most command, in the consummate fragments of the Parthenon; not, indeed, so that he who runs may read, the gifts of Greek sculpture being always delicate, and asking much of the receiver; but yet visible, and a pledge to us, of creative power, as, to the worshipper, of the presence, which, without that material pledge, had but vaguely haunted the fields and groves. This, then, was what the Greek imagination did for men's sense and experience of natural forces, in Athene, in Zeus, in Poseidon; for men's sense and experience of their own bodily qualities--swiftness, energy, power of concentrating sight and hand and foot on a momentary physical act--in the close hair, the chastened muscle, the perfectly poised attention of the quoit-player; for men's sense, again, of ethical qualities--restless idealism, inward vision, power of presence through that vision in scenes behind the experience of ordinary men--in the idealised Alexander. To illustrate this function of the imagination, as especially developed in Greek art, we may reflect on what happens with us in the use of certain names, as expressing summarily, this name for you and that for me--Helen, Gretchen, Mary--a hundred associations, trains of sound, forms, impressions, remembered in all sorts of degrees, which, through a very wide and full experience, they have the power of bringing with [37] them; in which respect, such names are but revealing instances of the whole significance, power, and use of language in general. Well,--the mythical conception, projected at last, in drama or sculpture, is the name, the instrument of the identification, of the given matter,--of its unity in variety, its outline or definition in mystery; its spiritual form, to use again the expression I have borrowed from William Blake--form, with hands, and lips, and opened eyelids--spiritual, as conveying to us, in that, the soul of rain, or of a Greek river, or of swiftness, or purity. To illustrate this, think what the effect would be, if you could associate, by some trick of memory, a certain group of natural objects, in all their varied perspective, their changes of colour and tone in varying light and shade, with the being and image of an actual person. You travelled through a country of clear rivers and wide meadows, or of high windy places, or of lowly grass and willows, or of the Lady of the Lake; and all the complex impressions of these objects wound themselves, as a second animated body, new and more subtle, around the person of some one left there, so that they no longer come to recollection apart from each other. Now try to conceive the image of an actual person, in whom, somehow, all those impressions of the vine and its fruit, as the highest type of the life of the green sap, had become incorporate;--all the scents and colours of its flower and fruit, and [38] something of its curling foliage; the chances of its growth; the enthusiasm, the easy flow of more choice expression, as its juices mount within one; for the image is eloquent, too, in word, gesture, and glancing of the eyes, which seem to be informed by some soul of the vine within it: as Wordsworth says, Beauty born of murmuring sound Shall pass into her face-- so conceive an image into which the beauty, \"born\" of the vine, has passed; and you have the idea of Dionysus, as he appears, entirely fashioned at last by central Greek poetry and art, and is consecrated in the Oinophoria and the Anthestêria,+ the great festivals of the Winepress and the Flowers. The word wine, and with it the germ of the myth of Dionysus, is older than the separation of the Indo-Germanic race. Yet, with the people of Athens, Dionysus counted as the youngest of the gods; he was also the son of a mortal, dead in childbirth, and seems always to have exercised the charm of the latest born, in a sort of allowable fondness. Through the fine-spun speculations of modern ethnologists and grammarians, noting the changes in the letters of his name, and catching at the slightest historical records of his worship, we may trace his coming from Phrygia, the birthplace of the more mystical elements of [39] Greek religion, over the mountains of Thrace. On the heights of Pangaeus he leaves an oracle, with a perpetually burning fire, famous down to the time of Augustus, who reverently visited it. Southwards still, over the hills of Parnassus, which remained for the inspired women of Boeotia the centre of his presence, he comes to Thebes, and the family of Cadmus. From Boeotia he passes to Attica; to the villages first; at last to Athens; at an assignable date, under Peisistratus; out of the country, into the town. To this stage of his town-life, that Dionysus of \"enthusiasm\" already belonged; it was to the Athenians of the town, to urbane young men, sitting together at the banquet, that those expressions of a sudden eloquence came, of the loosened utterance and finer speech, its colour and imagery. Dionysus, then, has entered Athens, to become urbane like them; to walk along the marble streets in frequent procession, in the persons of noble youths, like those who at the Oschophoria bore the branches of the vine from his temple, to the temple of Athene of the Parasol, or of beautiful slaves; to contribute through the arts to the adornment of life, yet perhaps also in part to weaken it, relaxing ancient austerity. Gradually, his rough country feasts will be outdone by the feasts of the town; and as comedy arose out of those, so these will give rise to tragedy. For his entrance upon this new stage of his career, his coming into the town, is from the [40] first tinged with melancholy, as if in entering the town he had put off his country peace. The other Olympians are above sorrow. Dionysus, like a strenuous mortal hero, like Hercules or Perseus, has his alternations of joy and sorrow, of struggle and hard-won triumph. It is out of the sorrows of Dionysus, then,--of Dionysus in winter--that all Greek tragedy grows; out of the song of the sorrows of Dionysus, sung at his winter feast by the chorus of satyrs, singers clad in goat-skins, in memory of his rural life, one and another of whom, from time to time, steps out of the company to emphasise and develope this or that circumstance of the story; and so the song becomes dramatic. He will soon forget that early country life, or remember it but as the dreamy background of his later existence. He will become, as always in later art and poetry, of dazzling whiteness; no longer dark with the air and sun, but like one eskiatrofêkôs+--brought up under the shade of Eastern porticoes or pavilions, or in the light that has only reached him softened through the texture of green leaves; honey-pale, like the delicate people of the city, like the flesh of women, as those old vase-painters conceive of it, who leave their hands and faces untouched with the pencil on the white clay. The ruddy god of the vineyard, stained with wine-lees, or coarser colour, will hardly recognise his double, in the white, graceful, mournful figure, weeping, chastened, lifting up his arms in yearning+ [41] affection towards his late-found mother, as we see him on a famous Etruscan mirror. Only, in thinking of this early tragedy, of these town- feasts, and of the entrance of Dionysus into Athens, you must suppose, not the later Athens which is oftenest in our thoughts, the Athens of Pericles and Pheidias; but that little earlier Athens of Peisistratus, which the Persians destroyed, which some of us perhaps would rather have seen, in its early simplicity, than the greater one; when the old image of the god, carved probably out of the stock of an enormous vine, had just come from the village of Eleutherae to his first temple in the Lenaeum--the quarter of the winepresses, near the Limnae--the marshy place, which in Athens represents the cave of Nysa; its little buildings on the hill-top, still with steep rocky ways, crowding round the ancient temple of Erechtheus and the grave of Cecrops, with the old miraculous olive-tree still growing there, and the old snake of Athene Polias still alive somewhere in the temple court. The artists of the Italian Renaissance have treated Dionysus many times, and with great effect, but always in his joy, as an embodiment of that glory of nature to which the Renaissance was a return. But in an early engraving of Mocetto there is for once a Dionysus treated differently. The cold light of the background displays a barren hill, the bridge and towers of [42] an Italian town, and quiet water. In the foreground, at the root of a vine, Dionysus is sitting, in a posture of statuesque weariness; the leaves of the vine are grandly drawn, and wreathing heavily round the head of the god, suggest the notion of his incorporation into it. The right hand, holding a great vessel languidly and indifferently, lets the stream of wine flow along the earth; while the left supports the forehead, shadowing heavily a face, comely, but full of an expression of painful brooding. One knows not how far one may really be from the mind of the old Italian engraver, in gathering from his design this impression of a melancholy and sorrowing Dionysus. But modern motives are clearer; and in a Bacchus by a young Hebrew painter, in the exhibition of the Royal Academy of 1868, there was a complete and very fascinating realisation of such a motive; the god of the bitterness of wine, \"of things too sweet\"; the sea-water of the Lesbian grape become somewhat brackish in the cup. Touched by the sentiment of this subtler, melancholy Dionysus, we may ask whether anything similar in feeling is to be actually found in the range of Greek ideas;--had some antitype of this fascinating figure any place in Greek religion? Yes; in a certain darker side of the double god of nature, obscured behind the brighter episodes of Thebes and Naxos, but never quite forgotten, something corresponding to this deeper, more refined idea, [43] really existed--the conception of Dionysus Zagreus; an image, which has left, indeed, but little effect in Greek art and poetry, which criticism has to put patiently together, out of late, scattered hints in various writers; but which is yet discernible, clearly enough to show that it really visited certain Greek minds here and there; and discernible, not as a late after- thought, but as a tradition really primitive, and harmonious with the original motive of the idea of Dionysus. In its potential, though unrealised scope, it is perhaps the subtlest dream in Greek religious poetry, and is, at least, part of the complete physiognomy of Dionysus, as it actually reveals itself to the modern student, after a complete survey. The whole compass of the idea of Dionysus, a dual god of both summer and winter, became ultimately, as we saw, almost identical with that of Demeter. The Phrygians believed that the god slept in winter and awoke in summer, and celebrated his waking and sleeping; or that he was bound and imprisoned in winter, and unbound in spring. We saw how, in Elis and at Argos, the women called him out of the sea, with the singing of hymns, in early spring; and a beautiful ceremony in the temple at Delphi, which, as we know, he shares with Apollo, described by Plutarch, represents his mystical resurrection. Yearly, about the time of the shortest day, just as the light begins to increase, [44] and while hope is still tremulously strung, the priestesses of Dionysus were wont to assemble with many lights at his shrine, and there, with songs and dances, awoke the new-born child after his wintry sleep, waving in a sacred cradle, like the great basket used for winnowing corn, a symbolical image, or perhaps a real infant. He is twofold then--a Döppelganger; like Persephone, he belongs to two worlds, and has much in common with her, and a full share of those dark possibilities which, even apart from the story of the rape, belong to her. He is a Chthonian god, and, like all the children of the earth, has an element of sadness; like Hades himself, he is hollow and devouring, an eater of man's flesh--sarcophagus--the grave which consumed unaware the ivory-white shoulder of Pelops. And you have no sooner caught a glimpse of this image, than a certain perceptible shadow comes creeping over the whole story; for, in effect, we have seen glimpses of the sorrowing Dionysus, all along. Part of the interest of the Theban legend of his birth is that he comes of the marriage of a god with a mortal woman; and from the first, like merely mortal heroes, he falls within the sphere of human chances. At first, indeed, the melancholy settles round the person of his mother, dead in childbirth, and ignorant of the glory of her son; in shame, according to Euripides; punished, as her own sisters allege, for impiety. The death of Semele [45] is a sort of ideal or type of this peculiar claim on human pity, as the descent of Persephone into Hades, of all human pity over the early death of women. Accordingly, his triumph being now consummated, he descends into Hades, through the unfathomable Alcyonian lake, according to the most central version of the legend, to bring her up from thence; and that Hermes, the shadowy conductor of souls, is constantly associated with Dionysus, in the story of his early life, is not without significance in this connexion. As in Delphi the winter months were sacred to him, so in Athens his feasts all fall within the four months on this and the other side of the shortest day; as Persephone spends those four months--a third part of the year--in Hades. Son or brother of Persephone he actually becomes at last, in confused, half- developed tradition; and even has his place, with his dark sister, in the Eleusinian mysteries, as Iacchus; where, on the sixth day of the feast, in the great procession from Athens to Eleusis, we may still realise his image, moving up and down above the heads of the vast multitude, as he goes, beside \"the two,\" to the temple of Demeter, amid the light of torches at noonday. But it was among the mountains of Thrace that this gloomier element in the being of Dionysus had taken the strongest hold. As in the sunny villages of Attica the cheerful elements of his religion had been developed, so, in those [46] wilder northern regions, people continued to brood over its darker side, and hence a current of gloomy legend descended into Greece. The subject of the Bacchanals of Euripides is the infatuated opposition of Pentheus, king of Thebes, to Dionysus and his religion; his cruelty to the god, whom he shuts up in prison, and who appears on the stage with his delicate limbs cruelly bound, but who is finally triumphant; Pentheus, the man of grief, being torn to pieces by his own mother, in the judicial madness sent upon her by the god. In this play, Euripides has only taken one of many versions of the same story, in all of which Dionysus is victorious, his enemy being torn to pieces by the sacred women, or by wild horses, or dogs, or the fangs of cold; or the maenad Ambrosia, whom he is supposed to pursue for purposes of lust, suddenly becomes a vine, and binds him down to the earth inextricably, in her serpentine coils. In all these instances, then, Dionysus punishes his enemies by repaying them in kind. But a deeper vein of poetry pauses at the sorrow, and in the conflict does not too soon anticipate the final triumph. It is Dionysus himself who exhausts these sufferings. Hence, in many forms--reflexes of all the various phases of his wintry existence--the image of Dionysus Zagreus, the Hunter--of Dionysus in winter--storming wildly on the dark Thracian hills, from which, like Ares and Boreas, he originally descends into [47] Greece; the thought of the hunter concentrating into itself all men's forebodings over the departure of the year at its richest, and the death of all sweet things in the long-continued cold, when the sick and the old and little children, gazing out morning after morning on the dun sky, can hardly believe in the return any more of a bright day. Or he is connected with the fears, the dangers and hardships of the hunter himself, lost or slain sometimes, far from home, in the dense woods of the mountains, as he seeks his meat so ardently; becoming, in his chase, almost akin to the wild beasts--to the wolf, who comes before us in the name of Lycurgus, one of his bitterest enemies--and a phase, therefore, of his own personality, in the true intention of the myth. This transformation, this image of the beautiful soft creature become an enemy of human kind, putting off himself in his madness, wronged by his own fierce hunger and thirst, and haunting, with terrible sounds, the high Thracian farms, is the most tragic note of the whole picture, and links him on to one of the gloomiest creations of later romance, the werewolf, the belief in which still lingers in Greece, as in France, where it seems to become incorporate in the darkest of all romantic histories, that of Gilles de Retz. And now we see why the tradition of human sacrifice lingered on in Greece, in connexion with Dionysus, as a thing of actual detail, and [48] not remote, so that Dionysius of Halicarnassus counts it among the horrors of Greek religion. That the sacred women of Dionysus ate, in mystical ceremony, raw flesh, and drank blood, is a fact often mentioned, and commemorates, as it seems, the actual sacrifice of a fair boy deliberately torn to pieces, fading at last into a symbolical offering. At Delphi, the wolf was preserved for him, on the principle by which Venus loves the dove, and Hera peacocks; and there were places in which, after the sacrifice of a kid to him, a curious mimic pursuit of the priest who had offered it represented the still surviving horror of one who had thrown a child to the wolves. The three daughters of Minyas devote themselves to his worship; they cast lots, and one of them offers her own tender infant to be torn by the three, like a roe; then the other women pursue them, and they are turned into bats, or moths, or other creatures of the night. And fable is endorsed by history; Plutarch telling us how, before the battle of Salamis, with the assent of Themistocles, three Persian captive youths were offered to Dionysus the Devourer. As, then, some embodied their fears of winter in Persephone, others embodied them in Dionysus, a devouring god, whose sinister side (as the best wine itself has its treacheries) is illustrated in the dark and shameful secret society described by Livy, in which his worship ended at Rome, afterwards abolished by solemn act of the senate. [49] He becomes a new Aidoneus, a hunter of men's souls; like him, to be appeased only by costly sacrifices. And then, Dionysus recovering from his mid-winter madness, how intensely these people conceive the spring! It is that triumphant Dionysus, cured of his great malady, and sane in the clear light of the longer days, whom Euripides in the Bacchanals sets before us, as still, essentially, the Hunter, Zagreus; though he keeps the red streams and torn flesh away from the delicate body of the god, in his long vesture of white and gold, and fragrant with Eastern odours. Of this I hope to speak in another paper; let me conclude this by one phase more of religious custom. If Dionysus, like Persephone, has his gloomy side, like her he has also a peculiar message for a certain number of refined minds, seeking, in the later days of Greek religion, such modifications of the old legend as may minister to ethical culture, to the perfecting of the moral nature. A type of second birth, from first to last, he opens, in his series of annual changes, for minds on the look-out for it, the hope of a possible analogy, between the resurrection of nature, and something else, as yet unrealised, reserved for human souls; and the beautiful, weeping creature, vexed by the wind, suffering, torn to pieces, and rejuvenescent again at last, like a tender shoot of living green out of the hardness and stony darkness+ [50] of the earth, becomes an emblem or ideal of chastening and purification, and of final victory through suffering. It is the finer, mystical sentiment of the few, detached from the coarser and more material religion of the many, and accompanying it, through the course of its history, as its ethereal, less palpable, life-giving soul, and, as always happens, seeking the quiet, and not too anxious to make itself felt by others. With some unfixed, though real, place in the general scheme of Greek religion, this phase of the worship of Dionysus had its special development in the Orphic literature and mysteries. Obscure as are those followers of the mystical Orpheus, we yet certainly see them, moving, and playing their part, in the later ages of Greek religion. Old friends with new faces, though they had, as Plato witnesses, their less worthy aspect, in certain appeals to vulgar, superstitious fears, they seem to have been not without the charm of a real and inward religious beauty, with their neologies, their new readings of old legends, their sense of mystical second meanings, as they refined upon themes grown too familiar, and linked, in a sophisticated age, the new to the old. In this respect, we may perhaps liken them to the mendicant orders in the Middle Ages, with their florid, romantic theology, beyond the bounds of orthodox tradition, giving so much new matter to art and poetry. They are a picturesque addition, also, to the exterior of Greek life, with [51] their white dresses, their dirges, their fastings and ecstasies, their outward asceticism and material purifications. And the central object of their worship comes before us as a tortured, persecuted, slain god--the suffering Dionysus--of whose legend they have their own special and esoteric version. That version, embodied in a supposed Orphic poem, The Occultation of Dionysus, is represented only by the details that have passed from it into the almost endless Dionysiaca of Nonnus, a writer of the fourth century; and the imagery has to be put back into the shrine, bit by bit, and finally incomplete. Its central point is the picture of the rending to pieces of a divine child, of whom a tradition, scanty indeed, but harmonious in its variations, had long maintained itself. It was in memory of it, that those who were initiated into the Orphic mysteries tasted of the raw flesh of the sacrifice, and thereafter ate flesh no more; and it connected itself with that strange object in the Delphic shrine, the grave of Dionysus. Son, first, of Zeus, and of Persephone whom Zeus woos, in the form of a serpent--the white, golden-haired child, the best-beloved of his father, and destined by him to be the ruler of the world, grows up in secret. But one day, Zeus, departing on a journey in his great fondness for the child, delivered to him his crown and staff, and so left him--shut in a strong tower. Then it came to pass that the jealous Here sent [52] out the Titans against him. They approached the crowned child, and with many sorts of playthings enticed him away, to have him in their power, and then miserably slew him-- hacking his body to pieces, as the wind tears the vine, with the axe Pelekus, which, like the swords of Roland and Arthur, has its proper name. The fragments of the body they boiled in a great cauldron, and made an impious banquet upon them, afterwards carrying the bones to Apollo, whose rival the young child should have been, thinking to do him service. But Apollo, in great pity for this his youngest brother, laid the bones in a grave, within his own holy place. Meanwhile, Here, full of her vengeance, brings to Zeus the heart of the child, which she had snatched, still beating, from the hands of the Titans. But Zeus delivered the heart to Semele; and the soul of the child remaining awhile in Hades, where Demeter made for it new flesh, was thereafter born of Semele--a second Zagreus--the younger, or Theban Dionysus.

Liddell and Scott definition: participle of skiatropheo, \"to rear in the shade.\" THE BACCHANALS OF EURIPIDES [53] So far, I have endeavoured to present, with something of the concrete character of a picture, Dionysus, the old Greek god, as we may discern him through a multitude of stray hints in art and poetry and religious custom, through modern speculation on the tendencies of early thought, through traits and touches in our own actual states of mind, which may seem sympathetic with those tendencies. In such a picture there must necessarily be a certain artificiality; things near and far, matter of varying degrees of certainty, fact and surmise, being reflected and concentrated, for its production, as if on the surface of a mirror. Such concrete character, however, Greek poet or sculptor, from time to time, impressed on the vague world of popular belief and usage around him; and in the Bacchanals of Euripides we have an example of the figurative or imaginative power of poetry, selecting and combining, at will, from that mixed and floating mass, weaving the many-coloured threads together, blending the various phases of legend--all the light and shade of the [54] subject--into a shape, substantial and firmly set, through which a mere fluctuating tradition might retain a permanent place in men's imaginations. Here, in what Euripides really says, in what we actually see on the stage, as we read his play, we are dealing with a single real object, not with uncertain effects of many half-fancied objects. Let me leave you for a time almost wholly in his hands, while you look very closely at his work, so as to discriminate its outlines clearly. This tragedy of the Bacchanals--a sort of masque or morality, as we say--a monument as central for the legend of Dionysus as the Homeric hymn for that of Demeter, is unique in Greek literature, and has also a singular interest in the life of Euripides himself. He is writing in old age (the piece was not played till after his death) not at Athens, nor for a polished Attic audience, but for a wilder and less temperately cultivated sort of people, at the court of Archelaus, in Macedonia. Writing in old age, he is in that subdued mood, a mood not necessarily sordid, in which (the shudder at the nearer approach of the unknown world coming over him more frequently than of old) accustomed ideas, conformable to a sort of common sense regarding the unseen, oftentimes regain what they may have lost, in a man's allegiance. It is a sort of madness, he begins to think, to differ from the received opinions thereon. Not that he is insincere or ironical, but that he tends, in the [55] sum of probabilities, to dwell on their more peaceful side; to sit quiet, for the short remaining time, in the reflexion of the more cheerfully lighted side of things; and what is accustomed--what holds of familiar usage-- comes to seem the whole essence of wisdom, on all subjects; and the well-known delineation of the vague country, in Homer or Hesiod, one's best attainable mental outfit, for the journey thither. With this sort of quiet wisdom the whole play is penetrated. Euripides has said, or seemed to say, many things concerning Greek religion, at variance with received opinion; and now, in the end of life, he desires to make his peace--what shall at any rate be peace with men. He is in the mood for acquiescence, or even for a palinode; and this takes the direction, partly of mere submission to, partly of a refining upon, the authorised religious tradition: he calmly sophisticates this or that element of it which had seemed grotesque; and has, like any modern writer, a theory how myths were made, and how in lapse of time their first signification gets to be obscured among mortals; and what he submits to, that he will also adorn fondly, by his genius for words. And that very neighbourhood afforded him his opportunity. It was in the neighbourhood of Pella, the Macedonian capital, that the worship of Dionysus, the newest of the gods, prevailed in its most extravagant form--the [56] Thiasus, or wild, nocturnal procession of Bacchic women, retired to the woods and hills for that purpose, with its accompaniments of music, and lights, and dancing. Rational and moderate Athenians, as we may gather from some admissions of Euripides himself, somewhat despised all that; while those who were more fanatical forsook the home celebrations, and went on pilgrimage from Attica to Cithaeron or Delphi. But at Pella persons of high birth took part in the exercise, and at a later period we read in Plutarch how Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great, was devoted to this enthusiastic worship. Although in one of Botticelli's pictures the angels dance very sweetly, and may represent many circumstances actually recorded in the Hebrew scriptures, yet we hardly understand the dance as a religious ceremony; the bare mention of it sets us thinking on some fundamental differences between the pagan religions and our own. It is to such ecstasies, however, that all nature-worship seems to tend; that giddy, intoxicating sense of spring--that tingling in the veins, sympathetic with the yearning life of the earth, having, apparently, in all times and places, prompted some mode of wild dancing. Coleridge, in one of his fantastic speculations, refining on the German word for enthusiasm-- Schwärmerei, swarming, as he says, \"like the swarming of bees together\"--has explained how the sympathies of mere numbers, as such, the random catching on [57] fire of one here and another there, when people are collected together, generates as if by mere contact, some new and rapturous spirit, not traceable in the individual units of a multitude. Such swarming was the essence of that strange dance of the Bacchic women: literally like winged things, they follow, with motives, we may suppose, never quite made clear even to themselves, their new, strange, romantic god. Himself a woman-like god,--it was on women and feminine souls that his power mainly fell. At Elis, it was the women who had their own little song with which at spring-time they professed to call him from the sea: at Brasiae they had their own temple where none but women might enter; and so the Thiasus, also, is almost exclusively formed of women--of those who experience most directly the influence of things which touch thought through the senses--the presence of night, the expectation of morning, the nearness of wild, unsophisticated, natural things--the echoes, the coolness, the noise of frightened creatures as they climbed through the darkness, the sunrise seen from the hill-tops, the disillusion, the bitterness of satiety, the deep slumber which comes with the morning. Athenians visiting the Macedonian capital would hear, and from time to time actually see, something of a religious custom, in which the habit of an earlier world might seem to survive. As they saw the lights flitting over the mountains, [58] and heard the wild, sharp cries of the women, there was presented, as a singular fact in the more prosaic actual life of a later time, an enthusiasm otherwise relegated to the wonderland of a distant past, in which a supposed primitive harmony and understanding between man and nature renewed itself. Later sisters of Centaur and Amazon, the Maenads, as they beat the earth in strange sympathy with its waking up from sleep, or as, in the description of the Messenger, in the play of Euripides, they lie sleeping in the glen, revealed among the morning mists, were themselves indeed as remnants--flecks left here and there and not yet quite evaporated under the hard light of a later and commoner day--of a certain cloud-world which had once covered all things with a veil of mystery. Whether or not, in what was often probably coarse as well as extravagant, there may have lurked some finer vein of ethical symbolism, such as Euripides hints at--the soberer influence, in the Thiasus, of keen air and animal expansion, certainly, for art, and a poetry delighting in colour and form, it was a custom rich in suggestion. The imitative arts would draw from it altogether new motives of freedom and energy, of freshness in old forms. It is from this fantastic scene that the beautiful wind-touched draperies, the rhythm, the heads suddenly thrown back, of many a Pompeian wall- painting and sarcophagus-frieze are originally derived; and that melting languor, that perfectly [59] composed lassitude of the fallen Maenad, became a fixed type in the school of grace, the school of Praxiteles. The circumstances of the place thus combining with his peculiar motive, Euripides writes the Bacchanals. It is this extravagant phase of religion, and the latest-born of the gods, which as an amende honorable to the once slighted traditions of Greek belief, he undertakes to interpret to an audience composed of people who, like Scyles, the Hellenising king of Scythia, feel the attraction of Greek religion and Greek usage, but on their quainter side, and partly relish that extravagance. Subject and audience alike stimulate the romantic temper, and the tragedy of the Bacchanals, with its innovations in metre and diction, expressly noted as foreign or barbarous--all the charm and grace of the clear-pitched singing of the chorus, notwithstanding--with its subtleties and sophistications, its grotesques, mingled with and heightening a real shudder at the horror of the theme, and a peculiarly fine and human pathos, is almost wholly without the reassuring calm, generally characteristic of the endings of Greek tragedy: is itself excited, troubled, disturbing--a spotted or dappled thing, like the oddly dappled fawn- skins of its own masquerade, so aptly expressive of the shifty, twofold, rapidly-doubling genius of the divine, wild creature himself. Let us listen and watch the strange masks coming and going, for a while, [60] as far as may be as we should do with a modern play. What are its charms? What is still alive, impressive, and really poetical for us, in the dim old Greek play? The scene is laid at Thebes, where the memory of Semele, the mother of Dionysus, is still under a cloud. Her own sisters, sinning against natural affection, pitiless over her pathetic death and finding in it only a judgment upon the impiety with which, having shamed herself with some mortal lover, she had thrown the blame of her sin upon Zeus, have, so far, triumphed over her. The true and glorious version of her story lives only in the subdued memory of the two aged men, Teiresias the prophet, and her father Cadmus, apt now to let things go loosely by, who has delegated his royal power to Pentheus, the son of one of those sisters--a hot-headed and impious youth. So things had passed at Thebes; and now a strange circumstance has happened. An odd sickness has fallen upon the women: Dionysus has sent the sting of his enthusiasm upon them, and has pushed it to a sort of madness, a madness which imitates the true Thiasus. Forced to have the form without the profit of his worship, the whole female population, leaving distaff and spindle, and headed by the three princesses, have deserted the town, and are lying encamped on the bare rocks, or under the pines, among the solitudes of Cithaeron. And it is just at this point that the divine child, [61] supposed to have perished at his mother's side in the flames, returns to his birthplace, grown to manhood. Dionysus himself speaks the prologue. He is on a journey through the world to found a new religion; and the first motive of this new religion is the vindication of the memory of his mother. In explaining this design, Euripides, who seeks always for pathetic effect, tells in few words, touching because simple, the story of Semele--here, and again still more intensely in the chorus which follows--the merely human sentiment of maternity being not forgotten, even amid the thought of the divine embraces of her fiery bed-fellow. It is out of tenderness for her that the son's divinity is to be revealed. A yearning affection, the affection with which we see him lifting up his arms about her, satisfied at last, on an old Etruscan metal mirror, has led him from place to place: everywhere he has had his dances and established his worship; and everywhere his presence has been her justification. First of all the towns in Greece he comes to Thebes, the scene of her sorrows: he is standing beside the sacred waters of Dirce and Ismenus: the holy place is in sight: he hears the Greek speech, and sees at last the ruins of the place of her lying-in, at once his own birth-chamber and his mother's tomb. His image, as it detaches itself little by little from the episodes of the play, and is further characterised by the [62] songs of the chorus, has a singular completeness of symbolical effect. The incidents of a fully developed human personality are superinduced on the mystical and abstract essence of that fiery spirit in the flowing veins of the earth--the aroma of the green world is retained in the fair human body, set forth in all sorts of finer ethical lights and shades--with a wonderful kind of subtlety. In the course of his long progress from land to land, the gold, the flowers, the incense of the East, have attached themselves deeply to him: their effect and expression rest now upon his flesh like the gleaming of that old ambrosial ointment of which Homer speaks as resting ever on the persons of the gods, and cling to his clothing--the mitre binding his perfumed yellow hair--the long tunic down to the white feet, somewhat womanly, and the fawn-skin, with its rich spots, wrapped about the shoulders. As the door opens to admit him, the scented air of the vineyards (for the vine-blossom has an exquisite perfume) blows through; while the convolvulus on his mystic rod represents all wreathing flowery things whatever, with or without fruit, as in America all such plants are still called vines. \"Sweet upon the mountains,\" the excitement of which he loves so deeply and to which he constantly invites his followers--\"sweet upon the mountains,\" and profoundly amorous, his presence embodies all the voluptuous abundance of Asia, its beating [63] sun, its \"fair-towered cities, full of inhabitants,\" which the chorus describe in their luscious vocabulary, with the rich Eastern names--Lydia, Persia, Arabia Felix: he is a sorcerer or an enchanter, the tyrant Pentheus thinks: the springs of water, the flowing of honey and milk and wine, are his miracles, wrought in person. We shall see presently how, writing for that northern audience, Euripides crosses the Theban with the gloomier Thracian legend, and lets the darker stain show through. Yet, from the first, amid all this floweriness, a touch or trace of that gloom is discernible. The fawn-skin, composed now so daintily over the shoulders, may be worn with the whole coat of the animal made up, the hoofs gilded and tied together over the right shoulder, to leave the right arm disengaged to strike, its head clothing the human head within, as Alexander, on some of his coins, looks out from the elephant's scalp, and Hercules out of the jaws of a lion, on the coins of Camarina. Those diminutive golden horns attached to the forehead, represent not fecundity merely, nor merely the crisp tossing of the waves of streams, but horns of offence. And our fingers must beware of the thyrsus, tossed about so wantonly by himself and his chorus. The pine-cone at its top does but cover a spear-point; and the thing is a weapon--the sharp spear of the hunter Zagreus--though hidden now by the fresh leaves, and that button of pine-cone (useful also to dip in [64] wine, to check the sweetness) which he has plucked down, coming through the forest, at peace for a while this spring morning. And the chorus emphasise this character, their songs weaving for the whole piece, in words more effective than any painted scenery, a certain congruous background which heightens all; the intimate sense of mountains and mountain things being in this way maintained throughout, and concentrated on the central figure. \"He is sweet among the mountains,\" they say, \"when he drops down upon the plain, out of his mystic musings\"--and we may think we see the green festoons of the vine dropping quickly, from foot-place to foot-place, down the broken hill-side in spring, when like the Bacchanals, all who can, wander out of the town to enjoy the earliest heats. \"Let us go out into the fields,\" we say; a strange madness seems to lurk among the flowers, ready to lay hold on us also; autika ga pasa choreusei+--soon the whole earth will dance and sing. Dionysus is especially a woman's deity, and he comes from the east conducted by a chorus of gracious Lydian women, his true sisters-- Bassarids, clad like himself in the long tunic, or bassara. They move and speak to the music of clangorous metallic instruments, cymbals and tambourines, relieved by the clearer notes of the pipe; and there is a strange variety of almost imitative sounds for such music, in their very [65] words. The Homeric hymn to Demeter precedes the art of sculpture, but is rich in suggestions for it; here, on the contrary, in the first chorus of the Bacchanals, as elsewhere in the play, we feel that the poetry of Euripides is probably borrowing something from art; that in these choruses, with their repetitions and refrains, he is reproducing perhaps the spirit of some sculptured relief which, like Luca della Robbia's celebrated work for the organ-loft of the cathedral of Florence, worked by various subtleties of line, not in the lips and eyes only, but in the drapery and hands also, to a strange reality of impression of musical effect on visible things. They beat their drums before the palace; and then a humourous little scene, a reflex of the old Dionysiac comedy--of that laughter which was an essential element of the earliest worship of Dionysus--follows the first chorus. The old blind prophet Teiresias, and the aged king Cadmus, always secretly true to him, have agreed to celebrate the Thiasus, and accept his divinity openly. The youthful god has nowhere said decisively that he will have none but young men in his sacred dance. But for that purpose they must put on the long tunic, and that spotted skin which only rustics wear, and assume the thyrsus and ivy-crown. Teiresias arrives and is seen knocking at the doors. And then, just as in the medieval mystery, comes the [66] inevitable grotesque, not unwelcome to our poet, who is wont in his plays, perhaps not altogether consciously, to intensify by its relief both the pity and the terror of his conceptions. At the summons of Teiresias, Cadmus appears, already arrayed like him in the appointed ornaments, in all their odd contrast with the infirmity and staidness of old age. Even in old men's veins the spring leaps again, and they are more than ready to begin dancing. But they are shy of the untried dress, and one of them is blind--poi dei choreuein; poi kathistanai poda; kai krata seisai polion;+ and then the difficulty of the way! the long, steep journey to the glens! may pilgrims boil their peas? might they proceed to the place in carriages? At last, while the audience laugh more or less delicately at their aged fumblings, in some co-operative manner, the eyes of the one combining with the hands of the other, the pair are about to set forth. Here Pentheus is seen approaching the palace in extreme haste. He has been absent from home, and returning, has just heard of the state of things at Thebes--the strange malady of the women, the dancings, the arrival of the mysterious stranger: he finds all the women departed from the town, and sees Cadmus and Teiresias in masque. Like the exaggerated diabolical figures in some of the religious plays and imageries of the Middle Age, he is an impersonation of stupid impiety, one of those whom the gods willing to [67] destroy first infatuate. Alternating between glib unwisdom and coarse mockery, between violence and a pretence of moral austerity, he understands only the sorriest motives; thinks the whole thing feigned, and fancies the stranger, so effeminate, so attractive of women with whom he remains day and night, but a poor sensual creature, and the real motive of the Bacchic women the indulgence of their lust; his ridiculous old grandfather he is ready to renounce, and accuses Teiresias of having in view only some fresh source of professional profit to himself in connexion with some new-fangled oracle; his petty spite avenges itself on the prophet by an order to root up the sacred chair, where he sits to watch the birds for divination, and disturb the order of his sacred place; and even from the moment of his entrance the mark of his doom seems already set upon him, in an impotent trembling which others notice in him. Those of the women who still loitered, he has already caused to be shut up in the common prison; the others, with Ino, Autonoe, and his own mother, Agave, he will hunt out of the glens; while the stranger is threatened with various cruel forms of death. But Teiresias and Cadmus stay to reason with him, and induce him to abide wisely with them; the prophet fittingly becomes the interpreter of Dionysus, and explains the true nature of the visitor; his divinity, the completion or counterpart of that of Demeter; his gift of prophecy; [68] all the soothing influences he brings with him; above all, his gift of the medicine of sleep to weary mortals. But the reason of Pentheus is already sickening, and the judicial madness gathering over it. Teiresias and Cadmus can but \"go pray.\" So again, not without the laughter of the audience, supporting each other a little grotesquely against a fall, they get away at last. And then, again, as in those quaintly carved and coloured imageries of the Middle Age--the martyrdom of the youthful Saint Firmin, for instance, round the choir at Amiens--comes the full contrast, with a quite medieval simplicity and directness, between the insolence of the tyrant, now at last in sight of his prey, and the outraged beauty of the youthful god, meek, surrounded by his enemies, like some fair wild creature in the snare of the hunter. Dionysus has been taken prisoner; he is led on to the stage, with his hands bound, but still holding the thyrsus. Unresisting he had submitted himself to his captors; his colour had not changed; with a smile he had bidden them do their will, so that even they are touched with awe, and are almost ready to admit his divinity. Marvellously white and red, he stands there; and now, unwilling to be revealed to the unworthy, and requiring a fitness in the receiver, he represents himself, in answer to the inquiries of Pentheus, not as Dionysus, but simply as the god's prophet, [69] in full trust in whom he desires to hear his sentence. Then the long hair falls to the ground under the shears; the mystic wand is torn from his hand, and he is led away to be tied up, like some dangerous wild animal, in a dark place near the king's stables. Up to this point in the play, there has been a noticeable ambiguity as to the person of Dionysus, the main figure of the piece; he is in part Dionysus, indeed; but in part, only his messenger, or minister preparing his way; a certain harshness of effect in the actual appearance of a god upon the stage being in this way relieved, or made easy, as by a gradual revelation in two steps. To Pentheus, in his invincible ignorance, his essence remains to the last unrevealed, and even the women of the chorus seem to understand in him, so far, only the forerunner of their real leader. As he goes away bound, therefore, they too, threatened also in their turn with slavery, invoke his greater original to appear and deliver them. In pathetic cries they reproach Thebes for rejecting them--ti m' anainei, ti me pheugeis;+ yet they foretell his future greatness; a new Orpheus, he will more than renew that old miraculous reign over animals and plants. Their song is full of suggestions of wood and river. It is as if, for a moment, Dionysus became the suffering vine again; and the rustle of the leaves and water come through their words to refresh it. The [70] fountain of Dirce still haunted by the virgins of Thebes, where the infant god was cooled and washed from the flecks of his fiery birth, becomes typical of the coolness of all springs, and is made, by a really poetic licence, the daughter of the distant Achelous--the earliest born, the father in myth, of all Greek rivers. A giddy sonorous scene of portents and surprises follows--a distant, exaggerated, dramatic reflex of that old thundering tumult of the festival in the vineyard--in which Dionysus reappears, miraculously set free from his bonds. First, in answer to the deep-toned invocation of the chorus, a great voice is heard from within, proclaiming him to be the son of Semele and Zeus. Then, amid the short, broken, rapturous cries of the women of the chorus, proclaiming him master, the noise of an earthquake passes slowly; the pillars of the palace are seen waving to and fro; while the strange, memorial fire from the tomb of Semele blazes up and envelopes the whole building. The terrified women fling themselves on the ground; and then, at last, as the place is shaken open, Dionysus is seen stepping out from among the tottering masses of the mimic palace, bidding them arise and fear not. But just here comes a long pause in the action of the play, in which we must listen to a messenger newly arrived from the glens, to tell us what he has seen there, among the Maenads. The singular, somewhat sinister beauty of this speech, and a [71] similar one subsequent--a fair description of morning on the mountain-tops, with the Bacchic women sleeping, which turns suddenly to a hard, coarse picture of animals cruelly rent--is one of the special curiosities which distinguish this play; and, as it is wholly narrative, I shall give it in English prose, abbreviating, here and there, some details which seem to have but a metrical value:-- \"I was driving my herd of cattle to the summit of the scaur to feed, what time the sun sent forth his earliest beams to warm the earth. And lo! three companies of women, and at the head of one of them Autonoe, thy mother Agave at the head of the second, and Ino at the head of the third. And they all slept, with limbs relaxed, leaned against the low boughs of the pines, or with head thrown heedlessly among the oak-leaves strewn upon the ground--all in the sleep of temperance, not, as thou saidst, pursuing Cypris through the solitudes of the forest, drunken with wine, amid the low rustling of the lotus-pipe. \"And thy mother, when she heard the lowing of the kine, stood up in the midst of them, and cried to them to shake off sleep. And they, casting slumber from their eyes, started upright, a marvel of beauty and order, young and old and maidens yet unmarried. And first, they let fall their hair upon their shoulders; and those [72] whose cinctures were unbound re-composed the spotted fawn-skins, knotting them about with snakes, which rose and licked them on the chin. Some, lately mothers, who with breasts still swelling had left their babes behind, nursed in their arms antelopes, or wild whelps of wolves, and yielded them their milk to drink; and upon their heads they placed crowns of ivy or of oak, or of flowering convolvulus. Then one, taking a thyrsus-wand, struck with it upon a rock, and thereupon leapt out a fine rain of water; another let down a reed upon the earth, and a fount of wine was sent forth there; and those whose thirst was for a white stream, skimming the surface with their finger-tips, gathered from it abundance of milk; and from the ivy of the mystic wands streams of honey distilled. Verily! hadst thou seen these things, thou wouldst have worshipped whom now thou revilest. \"And we shepherds and herdsmen came together to question with each other over this matter--what strange and terrible things they do. And a certain wayfarer from the city, subtle in speech, spake to us-- 'O! dwellers upon these solemn ledges of the hills, will ye that we hunt down, and take, amid her revelries, Agave, the mother of Pentheus, according to the king's pleasure?' And he seemed to us to speak wisely; and we lay in wait among the bushes; and they, at the time appointed, began moving their wands for the Bacchic dance, [73] calling with one voice upon Bromius!--Iacchus!--the son of Zeus! and the whole mountain was moved with ecstasy together, and the wild creatures; nothing but was moved in their running. And it chanced that Agave, in her leaping, lighted near me, and I sprang from my hiding-place, willing to lay hold on her; and she groaned out, 'O! dogs of hunting, these fellows are upon our traces; but follow me! follow! with the mystic wands for weapons in your hands.' And we, by flight, hardly escaped tearing to pieces at their hands, who thereupon advanced with knifeless fingers upon the young of the kine, as they nipped the green; and then hadst thou seen one holding a bleating calf in her hands, with udder distent, straining it asunder; others tore the heifers to shreds amongst them; tossed up and down the morsels lay in sight--flank or hoof--or hung from the fir-trees, dropping churned blood. The fierce, horned bulls stumbled forward, their breasts upon the ground, dragged on by myriad hands of young women, and in a moment the inner parts were rent to morsels. So, like a flock of birds aloft in flight, they retreat upon the level lands outstretched below, which by the waters of Asopus put forth the fair-flowering crop of Theban people--Hysiae and Erythrae--below the precipice of Cithaeron.\"-- A grotesque scene follows, in which the [74] humour we noted, on seeing those two old men diffidently set forth in chaplet and fawn- skin, deepens into a profound tragic irony. Pentheus is determined to go out in arms against the Bacchanals and put them to death, when a sudden desire seizes him to witness them in their encampment upon the mountains. Dionysus, whom he still supposes to be but a prophet or messenger of the god, engages to conduct him thither; and, for greater security among the dangerous women, proposes that he shall disguise himself in female attire. As Pentheus goes within for that purpose, he lingers for a moment behind him, and in prophetic speech declares the approaching end;--the victim has fallen into the net; and he goes in to assist at the toilet, to array him in the ornaments which he will carry to Hades, destroyed by his own mother's hands. It is characteristic of Euripides--part of his fine tact and subtlety--to relieve and justify what seems tedious, or constrained, or merely terrible and grotesque, by a suddenly suggested trait of homely pathos, or a glimpse of natural beauty, or a morsel of form or colour seemingly taken directly from picture or sculpture. So here, in this fantastic scene our thoughts are changed in a moment by the singing of the chorus, and divert for a while to the dark-haired tresses of the wood; the breath of the river-side is upon us; beside it, a fawn escaped from the hunter's net is flying swiftly in [75] its joy; like it, the Maenad rushes along; and we see the little head thrown back upon the neck, in deep aspiration, to drink in the dew. Meantime, Pentheus has assumed his disguise, and comes forth tricked up with false hair and the dress of a Bacchanal; but still with some misgivings at the thought of going thus attired through the streets of Thebes, and with many laughable readjustments of the unwonted articles of clothing. And with the woman's dress, his madness is closing faster round him; just before, in the palace, terrified at the noise of the earthquake, he had drawn sword upon a mere fantastic appearance, and pierced only the empty air. Now he begins to see the sun double, and Thebes with all its towers repeated, while his conductor seems to him transformed into a wild beast; and now and then, we come upon some touches of a curious psychology, so that we might almost seem to be reading a modern poet. As if Euripides had been aware of a not unknown symptom of incipient madness (it is said) in which the patient, losing the sense of resistance, while lifting small objects imagines himself to be raising enormous weights, Pentheus, as he lifts the thyrsus, fancies he could lift Cithaeron with all the Bacchanals upon it. At all this the laughter of course will pass round the theatre; while those who really pierce into the purpose of the poet, shudder, as they see the victim thus grotesquely clad going to his doom, [76] already foreseen in the ominous chant of the chorus--and as it were his grave-clothes, in the dress which makes him ridiculous. Presently a messenger arrives to announce that Pentheus is dead, and then another curious narrative sets forth the manner of his death. Full of wild, coarse, revolting details, of course not without pathetic touches, and with the loveliness of the serving Maenads, and of their mountain solitudes--their trees and water--never quite forgotten, it describes how, venturing as a spy too near the sacred circle, Pentheus was fallen upon, like a wild beast, by the mystic huntresses and torn to pieces, his mother being the first to begin \"the sacred rites of slaughter.\" And at last Agave herself comes upon the stage, holding aloft the head of her son, fixed upon the sharp end of the thyrsus, calling upon the women of the chorus to welcome the revel of the Evian god; who, accordingly, admit her into the company, professing themselves her fellow-revellers, the Bacchanals being thus absorbed into the chorus for the rest of the play. For, indeed, all through it, the true, though partly suppressed relation of the chorus to the Bacchanals is this, that the women of the chorus, staid and temperate for the moment, following Dionysus in his alternations, are but the paler sisters of his more wild and gloomy votaries--the true followers of the mystical Dionysus--the real chorus of Zagreus; the idea that their [77] violent proceedings are the result of madness only, sent on them as a punishment for their original rejection of the god, being, as I said, when seen from the deeper motives of the myth, only a \"sophism\" of Euripides--a piece of rationalism of which he avails himself for the purpose of softening down the tradition of which he has undertaken to be the poet. Agave comes on the stage, then, blood-stained, exulting in her \"victory of tears,\" still quite visibly mad indeed, and with the outward signs of madness, and as her mind wanders, musing still on the fancy that the dead head in her hands is that of a lion she has slain among the mountains--a young lion, she avers, as she notices the down on the young man's chin, and his abundant hair--a fancy in which the chorus humour her, willing to deal gently with the poor distraught creature. Supported by them, she rejoices \"exceedingly, exceedingly,\" declaring herself \"fortunate\" in such goodly spoil; priding herself that the victim has been slain, not with iron weapons, but with her own white fingers, she summons all Thebes to come and behold. She calls for her aged father to draw near and see; and for Pentheus himself, at last, that he may mount and rivet her trophy, appropriately decorative there, between the triglyphs of the cornice below the roof, visible to all. And now, from this point onwards, Dionysus himself becomes more and more clearly discernible [78] as the hunter, a wily hunter, and man the prey he hunts for; \"Our king is a hunter,\" cry the chorus, as they unite in Agave's triumph and give their sanction to her deed. And as the Bacchanals supplement the chorus, and must be added to it to make the conception of it complete; so in the conception of Dionysus also a certain transference, or substitution, must be made-- much of the horror and sorrow of Agave, of Pentheus, of the whole tragic situation, must be transferred to him, if we wish to realise in the older, profounder, and more complete sense of his nature, that mystical being of Greek tradition to whom all these experiences--his madness, the chase, his imprisonment and death, his peace again-- really belong; and to discern which, through Euripides' peculiar treatment of his subject, is part of the curious interest of this play. Through the sophism of Euripides! For that, again, is the really descriptive word, with which Euripides, a lover of sophisms, as Aristophanes knows, himself supplies us. Well;--this softened version of the Bacchic madness is a sophism of Euripides; and Dionysus Omophagus--the eater of raw flesh, must be added to the golden image of Dionysus Meilichius--the honey-sweet, if the old tradition in its completeness is to be, in spite of that sophism, our closing impression; if we are to catch, in its fulness, that deep undercurrent of horror which runs below, all through [79] this masque of spring, and realise the spectacle of that wild chase, in which Dionysus is ultimately both the hunter and the spoil. But meantime another person appears on the stage; Cadmus enters, followed by attendants bearing on a bier the torn limbs of Pentheus, which lying wildly scattered through the tangled wood, have been with difficulty collected and now decently put together and covered over. In the little that still remains before the end of the play, destiny now hurrying things rapidly forward, and strong emotions, hopes and forebodings being now closely packed, Euripides has before him an artistic problem of enormous difficulty. Perhaps this very haste and close-packing of the matter, which keeps the mind from dwelling overmuch on detail, relieves its real extravagance, and those who read it carefully will think that the pathos of Euripides has been equal to the occasion. In a few profoundly designed touches he depicts the perplexity of Cadmus, in whose house a god had become an inmate, only to destroy it--the regret of the old man for the one male child to whom that house had looked up as the pillar whereby aged people might feel secure; the piteous craziness of Agave; the unconscious irony with which she caresses the florid, youthful head of her son; the delicate breaking of the thing to her reviving intelligence, as Cadmus, though he can but wish that she might live on for ever in her visionary enjoyment, [80] prepares the way, by playing on that other horrible legend of the Theban house, the tearing of Actaeon to death--he too destroyed by a god. He gives us the sense of Agave's gradual return to reason through many glimmering doubts, till she wakes up at last to find the real face turned up towards the mother and murderess; the quite naturally spontaneous sorrow of the mother, ending with her confession, down to her last sigh, and the final breaking up of the house of Cadmus; with a result so genuine, heartfelt, and dignified withal in its expression of a strange ineffable woe, that a fragment of it, the lamentation of Agave over her son, in which the long-pent agony at last finds vent, were, it is supposed, adopted into his paler work by an early Christian poet, and have figured since, as touches of real fire, in the Christus Patiens of Gregory Nazianzen.

THE MYTH OF DEMETER AND PERSEPHONE: I [81] No chapter in the history of human imagination is more curious than the myth of Demeter, and Kore or Persephone. Alien in some respects from the genuine traditions of Greek mythology, a relic of the earlier inhabitants of Greece, and having but a subordinate place in the religion of Homer, it yet asserted its interest, little by little, and took a complex hold on the minds of the Greeks, becoming finally the central and most popular subject of their national worship. Following its changes, we come across various phases of Greek culture, which are not without their likenesses in the modern mind. We trace it in the dim first period of instinctive popular conception; we see it connecting itself with many impressive elements of art, and poetry, and religious custom, with the picturesque superstitions of the many, and with the finer intuitions of the few; and besides this, it is in itself full of [82] interest and suggestion, to all for whom the ideas of the Greek religion have any real meaning in the modern world. And the fortune of the myth has not deserted it in later times. In the year 1780, the long-lost text of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter was discovered among the manuscripts of the imperial library at Moscow; and, in our own generation, the tact of an eminent student of Greek art, Sir Charles Newton, has restored to the world the buried treasures of the little temple and precinct of Demeter, at Cnidus, which have many claims to rank in the central order of Greek sculpture. The present essay is an attempt to select and weave together, for those who are now approaching the deeper study of Greek thought, whatever details in the development of this myth, arranged with a view rather to a total impression than to the debate of particular points, may seem likely to increase their stock of poetical impressions, and to add to this some criticisms on the expression which it has left of itself in extant art and poetry. The central expression, then, of the story of Demeter and Persephone is the Homeric hymn, to which Grote has assigned a date at least as early as six hundred years before Christ. The one survivor of a whole family of hymns on this subject, it was written, perhaps, for one of those contests which took place on the seventh day of the Eleusinian festival, and in which a bunch of [83] ears of corn was the prize; perhaps, for actual use in the mysteries themselves, by the Hierophantes, or Interpreter, who showed to the worshippers at Eleusis those sacred places to which the poem contains so many references. About the composition itself there are many difficult questions, with various surmises as to why it has remained only in this unique manuscript of the end of the fourteenth century. Portions of the text are missing, and there are probably some additions by later hands; yet most scholars have admitted that it possesses some of the true characteristics of the Homeric style, some genuine echoes of the age immediately succeeding that which produced the Iliad and the Odyssey. Listen now to a somewhat abbreviated version of it. \"I begin the song of Demeter\"--says the prize-poet, or the Interpreter, the Sacristan of the holy places--\"the song of Demeter and her daughter Persephone, whom Aidoneus carried away by the consent of Zeus, as she played, apart from her mother, with the deep- bosomed daughters of the Ocean, gathering flowers in a meadow of soft grass--roses and the crocus and fair violets and flags, and hyacinths, and, above all, the strange flower of the narcissus, which the Earth, favouring the desire of Aidoneus, brought forth for the first time, to snare the footsteps of the flower-like girl. A hundred [84] heads of blossom grew up from the roots of it, and the sky and the earth and the salt wave of the sea were glad at the scent thereof. She stretched forth her hands to take the flower; thereupon the earth opened, and the king of the great nation of the dead sprang out with his immortal horses. He seized the unwilling girl, and bore her away weeping, on his golden chariot. She uttered a shrill cry, calling upon her father Zeus; but neither man nor god heard her voice, nor even the nymphs of the meadow where she played; except Hecate only, the daughter of Persaeus, sitting, as ever, in her cave, half veiled with a shining veil, thinking delicate thoughts; she, and the Sun also, heard her. \"So long as she could still see the earth, and the sky, and the sea with the great waves moving, and the beams of the sun, and still thought to see again her mother, and the race of the ever-living gods, so long hope soothed her, in the midst of her grief. The peaks of the hills and the depths of the sea echoed her cry. And the mother heard it. A sharp pain seized her at the heart; she plucked the veil from her hair, and cast down the blue hood from her shoulders, and fled forth like a bird, seeking Persephone over dry land and sea. But neither man nor god would tell her the truth; nor did any bird come to her as a sure messenger. \"Nine days she wandered up and down upon the earth, having blazing torches in her hands; [85] and, in her great sorrow, she refused to taste of ambrosia, or of the cup of the sweet nectar, nor washed her face. But when the tenth morning came, Hecate met her, having a light in her hands. But Hecate had heard the voice only, and had seen no one, and could not tell Demeter who had borne the girl away. And Demeter said not a word, but fled away swiftly with her, having the blazing torches in her hands, till they came to the Sun, the watchman both of gods and men; and the goddess questioned him, and the Sun told her the whole story. \"Then a more terrible grief took possession of Demeter, and, in her anger against Zeus, she forsook the assembly of the gods and abode among men, for a long time veiling her beauty under a worn countenance, so that none who looked upon her knew her, until she came to the house of Celeus, who was then king of Eleusis. In her sorrow, she sat down at the wayside by the virgin's well, where the people of Eleusis come to draw water, under the shadow of an olive- tree. She seemed as an aged woman whose time of child-bearing is gone by, and from whom the gifts of Aphrodite have been withdrawn, like one of the hired servants, who nurse the children or keep house, in kings' palaces. And the daughters of Celeus, four of them, like goddesses, possessing the flower of their youth, Callidice, Cleisidice, Demo, and Callithoe the eldest of them, coming to draw water that they [86] might bear it in their brazen pitchers to their father's house, saw Demeter and knew her not. The gods are hard for men to recognise. \"They asked her kindly what she did there, alone; and Demeter answered, dissemblingly, that she was escaped from certain pirates, who had carried her from her home and meant to sell her as a slave. Then they prayed her to abide there while they returned to the palace, to ask their mother's permission to bring her home. \"Demeter bowed her head in assent; and they, having filled their shining vessels with water, bore them away, rejoicing in their beauty. They came quickly to their father's house, and told their mother what they had seen and heard. Their mother bade them return, and hire the woman for a great price; and they, like the hinds or young heifers leaping in the fields in spring, fulfilled with the pasture, holding up the folds of their raiment, sped along the hollow road-way, their hair, in colour like the crocus, floating about their shoulders as they went. They found the glorious goddess still sitting by the wayside, unmoved. Then they led her to their father's house; and she, veiled from head to foot, in her deep grief, followed them on the way, and her blue robe gathered itself as she walked, in many folds about her feet. They came to the house, and passed through the sunny porch, where their mother, Metaneira, was [87] sitting against one of the pillars of the roof, having a young child in her bosom. They ran up to her; but Demeter crossed the threshold, and, as she passed through, her head rose and touched the roof, and her presence filled the doorway with a divine brightness. \"Still they did not wholly recognise her. After a time she was made to smile. She refused to drink wine, but tasted of a cup mingled of water and barley, flavoured with mint. It happened that Metaneira had lately borne a child. It had come beyond hope, long after its elder brethren, and was the object of a peculiar tenderness and of many prayers with all. Demeter consented to remain, and become the nurse of this child. She took the child in her immortal hands, and placed it in her fragrant bosom; and the heart of the mother rejoiced. Thus Demeter nursed Demophoon. And the child grew like a god, neither sucking the breast, nor eating bread; but Demeter daily anointed it with ambrosia, as if it had indeed been the child of a god, breathing sweetly over it and holding it in her bosom; and at nights, when she lay alone with the child, she would hide it secretly in the red strength of the fire, like a brand; for her heart yearned towards it, and she would fain have given to it immortal youth. \"But the foolishness of his mother prevented it. For a suspicion growing up within her, she awaited her time, and one night peeped in upon [88] them, and thereupon cried out in terror at what she saw. And the goddess heard her; and a sudden anger seizing her, she plucked the child from the fire and cast it on the ground,--the child she would fain have made immortal, but who must now share the common destiny of all men, though some inscrutable grace should still be his, because he had lain for awhile on the knees and in the bosom of the goddess. \"Then Demeter manifested herself openly. She put away the mask of old age, and changed her form, and the spirit of beauty breathed about her. A fragrant odour fell from her raiment, and her flesh shone from afar; the long yellow hair descended waving over her shoulders, and the great house was filled as with the brightness of lightning. She passed out through the halls; and Metaneira fell to the earth, and was speechless for a long time, and remembered not to lift the child from the ground. But the sisters, hearing its piteous cries, leapt from their beds and ran to it. Then one of them lifted the child from the earth, and wrapped it in her bosom, and another hastened to her mother's chamber to awake her: they came round the child, and washed away the flecks of the fire from its panting body, and kissed it tenderly all about: but the anguish of the child ceased not; the arms of other and different nurses were about to enfold it. \"So, all night, trembling with fear, they [89] sought to propitiate the glorious goddess; and in the morning they told all to their father, Celeus. And he, according to the commands of the goddess, built a fair temple; and all the people assisted; and when it was finished every man departed to his own home. Then Demeter returned, and sat down within the temple-walls, and remained still apart from the company of the gods, alone in her wasting regret for her daughter Persephone. \"And, in her anger, she sent upon the earth a year of grievous famine. The dry seed remained hidden in the soil; in vain the oxen drew the ploughshare through the furrows; much white seed-corn fell fruitless on the earth, and the whole human race had like to have perished, and the gods had no more service of men, unless Zeus had interfered. First he sent Iris, afterwards all the gods, one by one, to turn Demeter from her anger; but none was able to persuade her; she heard their words with a hard countenance, and vowed by no means to return to Olympus, nor to yield the fruit of the earth, until her eyes had seen her lost daughter again. Then, last of all, Zeus sent Hermes into the kingdom of the dead, to persuade Aidoneus to suffer his bride to return to the light of day. And Hermes found the king at home in his palace, sitting on a couch, beside the shrinking Persephone, consumed within herself by desire for her mother. A doubtful smile passed over [90] the face of Aidoneus; yet he obeyed the message, and bade Persephone return; yet praying her a little to have gentle thoughts of him, nor judge him too hardly, who was also an immortal god. And Persephone arose up quickly in great joy; only, ere she departed, he caused her to eat a morsel of sweet pomegranate, designing secretly thereby, that she should not remain always upon earth, but might some time return to him. And Aidoneus yoked the horses to his chariot; and Persephone ascended into it; and Hermes took the reins in his hands and drove out through the infernal halls; and the horses ran willingly; and they two quickly passed over the ways of that long journey, neither the waters of the sea, nor of the rivers, nor the deep ravines of the hills, nor the cliffs of the shore, resisting them; till at last Hermes placed Persephone before the door of the temple where her mother was; who, seeing her, ran out quickly to meet her, like a Maenad coming down a mountain-side, dusky with woods. \"So they spent all that day together in intimate communion, having many things to hear and tell. Then Zeus sent to them Rhea, his venerable mother, the oldest of divine persons, to bring them back reconciled, to the company of the gods; and he ordained that Persephone should remain two parts of the year with her mother, and one third part only with her husband, in the kingdom of the dead. So Demeter suffered [91] the earth to yield its fruits once more, and the land was suddenly laden with leaves and flowers and waving corn. Also she visited Triptolemus and the other princes of Eleusis, and instructed them in the performance of her sacred rites,--those mysteries of which no tongue may speak. Only, blessed is he whose eyes have seen them; his lot after death is not as the lot of other men!\" In the story of Demeter, as in all Greek myths, we may trace the action of three different influences, which have moulded it with varying effects, in three successive phases of its development. There is first its half-conscious, instinctive, or mystical, phase, in which, under the form of an unwritten legend, living from mouth to mouth, and with details changing as it passes from place to place, there lie certain primitive impressions of the phenomena of the natural world. We may trace it next in its conscious, poetical or literary, phase, in which the poets become the depositaries of the vague instinctive product of the popular imagination, and handle it with a purely literary interest, fixing its outlines, and simplifying or developing its situations. Thirdly, the myth passes into the ethical phase, in which the persons and the incidents of the poetical narrative are realised as abstract symbols, because intensely characteristic examples, of moral or spiritual conditions. [92] Behind the adventures of the stealing of Persephone and the wanderings of Demeter in search of her, as we find them in the Homeric hymn, we may discern the confused conception, under which that early age, in which the myths were first created, represented to itself those changes in physical things, that order of summer and winter, of which it had no scientific, or systematic explanation, but in which, nevertheless, it divined a multitude of living agencies, corresponding to those ascertained forces, of which our colder modern science tells the number and the names. Demeter--Demeter and Persephone, at first, in a sort of confused union--is the earth, in the fixed order of its annual changes, but also in all the accident and detail of the growth and decay of its children. Of this conception, floating loosely in the air, the poets of a later age take possession; they create Demeter and Persephone as we know them in art and poetry. From the vague and fluctuating union, in which together they had represented the earth and its changes, the mother and the daughter define themselves with special functions, and with fixed, well-understood relationships, the incidents and emotions of which soon weave themselves into a pathetic story. Lastly, in proportion as the literary or aesthetic activity completes the picture or the poem, the ethical interest makes itself felt. These strange persons--Demeter and Persephone--these marvellous incidents-- the translation into Hades, the seeking [93] of Demeter, the return of Persephone to her,--lend themselves to the elevation and correction of the sentiments of sorrow and awe, by the presentment to the senses and the imagination of an ideal expression of them. Demeter cannot but seem the type of divine grief. Persephone is the goddess of death, yet with a promise of life to come. Those three phases, then, which are more or less discernible in all mythical development, and constitute a natural order in it, based on the necessary conditions of human apprehension, are fixed more plainly, perhaps, than in any other passage of Greek mythology in the story of Demeter. And as the Homeric hymn is the central expression of its literary or poetical phase, so the marble remains, of which I shall have to speak by and bye, are the central extant illustration of what I have called its ethical phase. Homer, in the Iliad, knows Demeter, but only as the goddess of the fields, the originator and patroness of the labours of the countryman, in their yearly order. She stands, with her hair yellow like the ripe corn, at the threshing-floor, and takes her share in the toil, the heap of grain whitening, as the flails, moving in the wind, disperse the chaff. Out in the fresh fields, she yields to the embraces of Iasion, to the extreme jealousy of Zeus, who slays her mortal lover with lightning. The flowery town of Pyrasus--the wheat- town,--an ancient place in Thessaly, is her sacred precinct. But when [94] Homer gives a list of the orthodox gods, her name is not mentioned. Homer, in the Odyssey, knows Persephone also, but not as Kore; only as the queen of the dead--epainê Persephonê+--dreadful Persephone, the goddess of destruction and death, according to the apparent import of her name.+ She accomplishes men's evil prayers; she is the mistress and manager of men's shades, to which she can dispense a little more or less of life, dwelling in her mouldering palace on the steep shore of the Oceanus, with its groves of barren willows and tall poplars. But that Homer knew her as the daughter of Demeter there are no signs; and of his knowledge of the rape of Persephone there is only the faintest sign,--he names Hades by the golden reins of his chariot, and his beautiful horses. The main theme, then, the most characteristic peculiarities, of the story, as subsequently developed, are not to be found, expressly, in the true Homer. We have in him, on the one hand, Demeter, as the perfectly fresh and blithe goddess of the fields, whose children, if she has them, must be as the perfectly discreet and peaceful, unravished Kore; on the other hand, we have Persephone, as the wholly terrible goddess of death, who brings to Ulysses the querulous shadows of the dead, and has the head of the gorgon Medusa in her keeping. And it is only when these two contrasted images have been [95] brought into intimate relationship, only when Kore and Persephone have been identified, that the deeper mythology of Demeter begins. This combination has taken place in Hesiod; and in three lines of the Theogony we find the stealing of Persephone by Aidoneus,*--one of those things in Hesiod, perhaps, which are really older than Homer. Hesiod has been called the poet of helots, and is thought to have preserved some of the traditions of those earlier inhabitants of Greece who had become a kind of serfs; and in a certain shadowiness in his conceptions of the gods, contrasting with the concrete and heroic forms of the gods of Homer, we may perhaps trace something of the quiet unspoken brooding of a subdued people--of that silently dreaming temper to which the story of Persephone properly belongs. However this may be, it is in Hesiod that the two images, unassociated in Homer--the goddess of summer and the goddess of death, Kore and Persephone--are identified with much significance; and that strange, dual being makes her first appearance, whose latent capabilities the poets afterwards developed; among the rest, a peculiar blending of those two contrasted aspects, full of purpose for the duly chastened intelligence; death, resurrection, rejuvenescence.--Awake, and sing, ye that dwell in the dust! [96] Modern science explains the changes of the natural world by the hypothesis of certain unconscious forces; and the sum of these forces, in their combined action, constitutes the scientific conception of nature. But, side by side with the growth of this more mechanical conception, an older and more spiritual, Platonic, philosophy has always maintained itself, a philosophy more of instinct than of the understanding, the mental starting-point of which is not an observed sequence of outward phenomena, but some such feeling as most of us have on the first warmer days in spring, when we seem to feel the genial processes of nature actually at work; as if just below the mould, and in the hard wood of the trees, there were really circulating some spirit of life, akin to that which makes its energies felt within ourselves. Starting with a hundred instincts such as this, that older unmechanical, spiritual, or Platonic, philosophy envisages nature rather as the unity of a living spirit or person, revealing itself in various degrees to the kindred spirit of the observer, than as a system of mechanical forces. Such a philosophy is a systematised form of that sort of poetry (we may study it, for instance, either in Shelley or in Wordsworth), which also has its fancies of a spirit of the earth, or of the sky,--a personal intelligence abiding in them, the existence of which is assumed in every suggestion such poetry makes to us of a sympathy between the ways [97] and aspects of outward nature and the moods of men. And what stood to the primitive intelligence in place of such metaphysical conceptions were those cosmical stories or myths, such as this of Demeter and Persephone, which springing up spontaneously in many minds, came at last to represent to them, in a certain number of sensibly realised images, all they knew, felt, or fancied, of the natural world about them. The sky in its unity and its variety,--the sea in its unity and its variety,--mirrored themselves respectively in these simple, but profoundly impressible spirits, as Zeus, as Glaucus or Poseidon. And a large part of their experience--all, that is, that related to the earth in its changes, the growth and decay of all things born of it--was covered by the story of Demeter, the myth of the earth as a mother. They thought of Demeter as the old Germans thought of Hertha, or the later Greeks of Pan, as the Egyptians thought of Isis, the land of the Nile, made green by the streams of Osiris, for whose coming Isis longs, as Demeter for Persephone; thus naming together in her all their fluctuating thoughts, impressions, suspicions, of the earth and its appearances, their whole complex divination of a mysterious life, a perpetual working, a continuous act of conception there. Or they thought of the many-coloured earth as the garment of Demeter, as the great modern pantheist poet speaks of it as the \"garment of God.\" Its [98] brooding fertility; the spring flowers breaking from its surface, the thinly disguised unhealthfulness of their heavy perfume, and of their chosen places of growth; the delicate, feminine, Prosperina-like motion of all growing things; its fruit, full of drowsy and poisonous, or fresh, reviving juices; its sinister caprices also, its droughts and sudden volcanic heats; the long delays of spring; its dumb sleep, so suddenly flung away; the sadness which insinuates itself into its languid luxuriance; all this grouped itself round the persons of Demeter and her circle. They could turn always to her, from the actual earth itself, in aweful yet hopeful prayer, and a devout personal gratitude, and explain it through her, in its sorrow and its promise, its darkness and its helpfulness to man. The personification of abstract ideas by modern painters or sculptors, of wealth, of commerce, of health, for instance, shocks, in most cases, the aesthetic sense, as something conventional or rhetorical, as a mere transparent allegory, or figure of speech, which could please almost no one. On the other hand, such symbolical representations, under the form of human persons, as Giotto's Virtues and Vices at Padua, or his Saint Poverty at Assisi, or the series of the planets in certain early Italian engravings, are profoundly poetical and impressive. They seem to be something more than mere symbolism, [99] and to be connected with some peculiarly sympathetic penetration, on the part of the artist, into the subjects he intended to depict. Symbolism intense as this, is the creation of a special temper, in which a certain simplicity, taking all things literally, au pied de la lettre, is united to a vivid pre-occupation with the aesthetic beauty of the image itself, the figured side of figurative expression, the form of the metaphor. When it is said, \"Out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword,\" that temper is ready to deal directly and boldly with that difficult image, like that old designer of the fourteenth century, who has depicted this, and other images of the Apocalypse, in a coloured window at Bourges. Such symbolism cares a great deal for the hair of Temperance, discreetly bound, for some subtler likeness to the colour of the sky in the girdle of Hope, for the inwoven flames in the red garment of Charity. And what was specially peculiar to the temper of the old Florentine painter, Giotto, to the temper of his age in general, doubtless, more than to that of ours, was the persistent and universal mood of the age in which the story of Demeter and Persephone was first created. If some painter of our own time has conceived the image of The Day so intensely, that we hardly think of distinguishing between the image, with its girdle of dissolving morning mist, and the meaning of the image; if William Blake, to our so great delight, makes the morning stars [100] literally \"sing together,\"--these fruits of individual genius are in part also a \"survival\" from a different age, with the whole mood of which this mode of expression was more congruous than it is with ours. But there are traces of the old temper in the man of to-day also; and through these we can understand that earlier time--a very poetical time, with the more highly gifted peoples--in which every impression men received of the action of powers without or within them suggested to them the presence of a soul or will, like their own--a person, with a living spirit, and senses, and hands, and feet; which, when it talked of the return of Kore to Demeter, or the marriage of Zeus and Here, was not using rhetorical language, but yielding to a real illusion; to which the voice of man \"was really a stream, beauty an effluence, death a mist.\" The gods of Greek mythology overlap each other; they are confused or connected with each other, lightly or deeply, as the case may be, and sometimes have their doubles, at first sight as in a troubled dream, yet never, when we examine each detail more closely, without a certain truth to human reason. It is only in a limited sense that it is possible to lift, and examine by itself, one thread of the network of story and imagery, which, in a certain age of civilisation, wove itself over every detail of life and thought, over every name in the past, and almost every place in [101] Greece. The story of Demeter, then, was the work of no single author or place or time; the poet of its first phase was no single person, but the whole consciousness of an age, though an age doubtless with its differences of more or less imaginative individual minds--with one, here or there, eminent, though but by a little, above a merely receptive majority, the spokesman of a universal, though faintly-felt prepossession, attaching the errant fancies of the people around him to definite names and images. The myth grew up gradually, and at many distant places, in many minds, independent of each other, but dealing in a common temper with certain elements and aspects of the natural world, as one here, and another there, seemed to catch in that incident or detail which flashed more incisively than others on the inward eye, some influence, or feature, or characteristic of the great mother. The various epithets of Demeter, the local variations of her story, its incompatible incidents, bear witness to the manner of its generation. They illustrate that indefiniteness which is characteristic of Greek mythology, a theology with no central authority, no link on historic time, liable from the first to an unobserved transformation. They indicate the various, far-distant spots from which the visible body of the goddess slowly collected its constituents, and came at last to have a well-defined existence in the popular mind. In this sense, Demeter appears to one in [102] her anger, sullenly withholding the fruits of the earth, to another in her pride of Persephone, to another in her grateful gift of the arts of agriculture to man; at last only, is there a general recognition of a clearly-arrested outline, a tangible embodiment, which has solidified itself in the imagination of the people, they know not how. The worship of Demeter belongs to that older religion, nearer to the earth, which some have thought they could discern, behind the more definitely national mythology of Homer. She is the goddess of dark caves, and is not wholly free from monstrous form. She gave men the first fig in one place, the first poppy in another; in another, she first taught the old Titans to mow. She is the mother of the vine also; and the assumed name by which she called herself in her wanderings, is Dôs--a gift; the crane, as the harbinger of rain, is her messenger among the birds. She knows the magic powers of certain plants, cut from her bosom, to bane or bless; and, under one of her epithets, herself presides over the springs, as also coming from the secret places of the earth. She is the goddess, then, at first, of the fertility of the earth in its wildness; and so far, her attributes are to some degree confused with those of the Thessalian Gaia and the Phrygian Cybele. Afterwards, and it is now that her most characteristic attributes begin to concentrate themselves, [103] she separates herself from these confused relationships, as specially the goddess of agriculture, of the fertility of the earth when furthered by human skill. She is the preserver of the seed sown in hope, under many epithets derived from the incidents of vegetation, as the simple countryman names her, out of a mind full of the various experiences of his little garden or farm. She is the most definite embodiment of all those fluctuating mystical instincts, of which Gaia,* the mother of the earth's gloomier offspring, is a vaguer and mistier one. There is nothing of the confused outline, the mere shadowiness of mystical dreaming, in this most concrete human figure. No nation, less aesthetically gifted than the Greeks, could have thus lightly thrown its mystical surmise and divination into images so clear and idyllic as those of the solemn goddess of the country, in whom the characteristics of the mother are expressed with so much tenderness, and the \"beauteous head\" of Kore, then so fresh and peaceful. In this phase, then, the story of Demeter appears as the peculiar creation of country-people of a high impressibility, dreaming over their work in spring or autumn, half consciously touched by a sense of its sacredness, and a sort of [104] mystery about it. For there is much in the life of the farm everywhere which gives to persons of any seriousness of disposition, special opportunity for grave and gentle thoughts. The temper of people engaged in the occupations of country life, so permanent, so \"near to nature,\" is at all times alike; and the habitual solemnity of thought and expression which Wordsworth found in the peasants of Cumberland, and the painter François Millet in the peasants of Brittany, may well have had its prototype in early Greece. And so, even before the development, by the poets, of their aweful and passionate story, Demeter and Persephone seem to have been pre-eminently the venerable, or aweful, goddesses. Demeter haunts the fields in spring, when the young lambs are dropped; she visits the barns in autumn; she takes part in mowing and binding up the corn, and is the goddess of sheaves. She presides over all the pleasant, significant details of the farm, the threshing-floor and the full granary, and stands beside the woman baking bread at the oven. With these fancies are connected certain simple rites; the half-understood local observance, and the half- believed local legend, reacting capriciously on each other. They leave her a fragment of bread and a morsel of meat, at the cross- roads, to take on her journey; and perhaps some real Demeter carries them away, as she wanders through the country. The incidents of their yearly labour become to [105] them acts of worship; they seek her blessing through many expressive names, and almost catch sight of her, at dawn or evening, in the nooks of the fragrant fields. She lays a finger on the grass at the road-side, and some new flower comes up. All the picturesque implements of country life are hers; the poppy also, emblem of an inexhaustible fertility, and full of mysterious juices for the alleviation of pain. The countrywoman who puts her child to sleep in the great, cradle-like, basket, for winnowing the corn, remembers Demeter Courotrophos, the mother of corn and children alike, and makes it a little coat out of the dress worn by its father at his initiation into her mysteries. Yet she is an angry goddess too, sometimes--Demeter Erinnys, the goblin of the neighbourhood, haunting its shadowy places. She lies on the ground out of doors on summer nights, and becomes wet with the dew. She grows young again every spring, yet is of great age, the wrinkled woman of the Homeric hymn, who becomes the nurse of Demophoon. Other lighter, errant stories nest themselves, as time goes on, within the greater. The water-newt, which repels the lips of the traveller who stoops to drink, is a certain urchin, Abas, who spoiled by his mockery the pleasure of the thirsting goddess, as she drank once of a wayside spring in her wanderings. The night-owl is the transformed Ascalabus, who alone had seen Persephone eat that morsel [106] of pomegranate, in the garden of Aidoneus. The bitter wild mint was once a girl, who for a moment had made her jealous, in Hades. The episode of Triptolemus, to whom Demeter imparts the mysteries of the plough, like the details of some sacred rite, that he may bear them abroad to all people, embodies, in connexion with her, another group of the circumstances of country life. As with all the other episodes of the story, there are here also local variations, traditions of various favourites of the goddess at different places, of whom grammarians can tell us, finally obscured behind the greater fame of Triptolemus of Eleusis. One might fancy, at first, that Triptolemus was a quite Boeotian divinity, of the ploughshare. Yet we know that the thoughts of the Greeks concerning the culture of the earth from which they came, were most often noble ones; and if we examine carefully the works of ancient art which represent him, the second thought will suggest itself, that there was nothing clumsy or coarse about this patron of the plough--something, rather, of the movement of delicate wind or fire, about him and his chariot. And this finer character is explained, if, as we are justified in doing, we bring him into closest connexion with that episode, so full of a strange mysticism, of the Nursing of Demophoon, in the Homeric hymn. For, according to some traditions, none other [107] than Triptolemus himself was the subject of that mysterious experiment, in which Demeter laid the child nightly, in the red heat of the fire; and he lives afterwards, not immortal indeed, not wholly divine, yet, as Shakspere says, a \"nimble spirit,\" feeling little of the weight of the material world about him--the element of winged fire in the clay. The delicate, fresh, farm-lad we may still actually see sometimes, like a graceful field-flower among the corn, becomes, in the sacred legend of agriculture, a king's son; and then, the fire having searched out from him the grosser elements on that famous night, all compact now of spirit, a priest also, administering the gifts of Demeter to all the earth. Certainly, the extant works of art which represent him, gems or vase-paintings, conform truly enough to this ideal of a \"nimble spirit,\" though he wears the broad country hat, which Hermes also wears, going swiftly, half on the airy, mercurial wheels of his farm instrument, harrow or plough--half on wings of serpents--the worm, symbolical of the soil, but winged, as sending up the dust committed to it, after subtle firing, in colours and odours of fruit and flowers. It is an altogether sacred character, again, that he assumes in another precious work, of the severer period of Greek art, lately discovered at Eleusis, and now preserved in the museum of Athens, a singularly refined bas-relief, in which he stands, a firm and serious youth, between Demeter and [108] Persephone, who places her hand as with some sacred influence, and consecrating gesture, upon him. But the house of the prudent countryman will be, of course, a place of honest manners; and Demeter Thesmophoros is the guardian of married life, the deity of the discretion of wives. She is therefore the founder of civilised order. The peaceful homes of men, scattered about the land, in their security--Demeter represents these fruits of the earth also, not without a suggestion of the white cities, which shine upon the hills above the waving fields of corn, seats of justice and of true kingship. She is also in a certain sense the patron of travellers, having, in her long wanderings after Persephone, recorded and handed down those omens, caught from little things--the birds which crossed her path, the persons who met her on the way, the words they said, the things they carried in their hands, einodia symbola+--by noting which, men bring their journeys to a successful end; so that the simple countryman may pass securely on his way; and is led by signs from the goddess herself, when he travels far to visit her, at Hermione or Eleusis. So far the attributes of Demeter and Kore are similar. In the mythical conception, as in the religious acts connected with it, the mother and the daughter are almost interchangeable; [109] they are the two goddesses, the twin-named. Gradually, the office of Persephone is developed, defines itself; functions distinct from those of Demeter are attributed to her. Hitherto, always at the side of Demeter and sharing her worship, she now appears detached from her, going and coming, on her mysterious business. A third part of the year she abides in darkness; she comes up in the spring; and every autumn, when the countryman sows his seed in the earth, she descends thither again, and the world of the dead lies open, spring and autumn, to let her in and out. Persephone, then, is the summer- time, and, in this sense, a daughter of the earth; but the summer as bringing winter; the flowery splendour and consummated glory of the year, as thereafter immediately beginning to draw near to its end, as the first yellow leaf crosses it, in the first severer wind. She is the last day of spring, or the first day of autumn, in the threefold division of the Greek year. Her story is, indeed, but the story, in an intenser form, of Adonis, of Hyacinth, of Adrastus--the king's blooming son, fated, in the story of Herodotus, to be wounded to death with an iron spear--of Linus, a fair child who is torn to pieces by hounds every spring-time--of the English Sleeping Beauty. From being the goddess of summer and the flowers, she becomes the goddess of night and sleep and death, confuseable with Hecate, the goddess of midnight [110] terrors--Korê arrêtos,+ the mother of the Erinnyes, who appeared to Pindar, to warn him of his approaching death, upbraiding him because he had made no hymn in her praise, which swan's song he thereupon began, but finished with her. She is a twofold goddess, therefore, according as one or the other of these two contrasted aspects of her nature is seized, respectively. A duality, an inherent opposition in the very conception of Persephone, runs all through her story, and is part of her ghostly power. There is ever something in her of a divided or ambiguous identity: hence the many euphemisms of later language concerning her. The \"worship of sorrow,\" as Goethe called it, is sometimes supposed to have had almost no place in the religion of the Greeks. Their religion has been represented as a religion of mere cheerfulness, the worship by an untroubled, unreflecting humanity, conscious of no deeper needs, of the embodiments of its own joyous activity. It helped to hide out of their sight those traces of decay and weariness, of which the Greeks were constitutionally shy, to keep them from peeping too curiously into certain shadowy places, appropriate enough to the gloomy imagination of the middle age; and it hardly proposed to itself to give consolation to people who, in truth, were never \"sick or sorry.\" But this familiar view of Greek religion is based on a consideration of a part only of what is known [111] concerning it, and really involves a misconception, akin to that which underestimates the influence of the romantic spirit generally, in Greek poetry and art; as if Greek art had dealt exclusively with human nature in its sanity, suppressing all motives of strangeness, all the beauty which is born of difficulty, permitting nothing but an Olympian, though perhaps somewhat wearisome calm. In effect, such a conception of Greek art and poetry leaves in the central expressions of Greek culture none but negative qualities; and the legend of Demeter and Persephone, perhaps the most popular of all Greek legends, is sufficient to show that the \"worship of sorrow\" was not without its function in Greek religion; their legend is a legend made by and for sorrowful, wistful, anxious people; while the most important artistic monuments of that legend sufficiently prove that the Romantic spirit was really at work in the minds of Greek artists, extracting by a kind of subtle alchemy, a beauty, not without the elements of tranquillity, of dignity and order, out of a matter, at first sight painful and strange. The student of origins, as French critics say, of the earliest stages of art and poetry, must be content to follow faint traces; and in what has been here said, much may seem to have been made of little, with too much completion, by a general framework or setting, of what after [112] all are but doubtful or fragmentary indications. Yet there is a certain cynicism too, in that over-positive temper, which is so jealous of our catching any resemblance in the earlier world to the thoughts that really occupy our own minds, and which, in its estimate of the actual fragments of antiquity, is content to find no seal of human intelligence upon them. Slight indeed in themselves, these fragmentary indications become suggestive of much, when viewed in the light of such general evidence about the human imagination as is afforded by the theory of \"comparative mythology,\" or what is called the theory of \"animism.\" Only, in the application of these theories, the student of Greek religion must never forget that, after all, it is with poetry, not with systematic theological belief or dogma, that he has to do. As regards this story of Demeter and Persephone, what we actually possess is some actual fragments of poetry, some actual fragments of sculpture; and with a curiosity, justified by the direct aesthetic beauty of these fragments, we feel our way backwards to that engaging picture of the poet-people, with which the ingenuity of modern theory has filled the void in our knowledge. The abstract poet of that first period of mythology, creating in this wholly impersonal, intensely spiritual way,--the abstract spirit of poetry itself, rises before the mind; and, in speaking of this poetical age, we must take heed, before all things, in no sense to misconstrue the poets.

In that world of floating fancies there was a struggle for life; there were myths which never emerged from that first stage of popular conception, or were absorbed by stronger competitors, because, as some true heroes have done, they lacked the sacred poet or prophet, and were never remodelled by literature; while, out of the myth of Demeter, under the careful conduct of poetry and art, came the little pictures, the idylls, of the Homeric hymn, and the gracious imagery of Praxiteles. The myth has now entered its second or poetical phase, then, in which more definite fancies are grouped about the primitive stock, in a conscious literary temper, and the whole interest settles round the images of the beautiful girl going down into the darkness, and the weary woman who seeks her lost daughter--divine persons, then sincerely believed in by the majority of the Greeks. The Homeric hymn [114] is the central monument of this second phase. In it, the changes of the natural year have become a personal history, a story of human affection and sorrow, yet with a far-reaching religious significance also, of which the mere earthly spring and autumn are but an analogy; and in the development of this human element, the writer of the hymn sometimes displays a genuine power of pathetic expression. The whole episode of the fostering of Demophoon, in which over the body of the dying child human longing and regret are blent so subtly with the mysterious design of the goddess to make the child immortal, is an excellent example of the sentiment of pity in literature. Yet though it has reached the stage of conscious literary interpretation, much of its early mystical or cosmical character still lingers about the story, as it is here told. Later mythologists simply define the personal history; but in this hymn we may, again and again, trace curious links of connexion with the original purpose of the myth. Its subject is the weary woman, indeed, our Lady of Sorrows, the mater dolorosa of the ancient world, but with a certain latent reference, all through, to the mystical person of the earth. Her robe of dark blue is the raiment of her mourning, but also the blue robe of the earth in shadow, as we see it in Titian's landscapes; her great age is the age of the immemorial earth; she becomes a nurse, therefore, holding Demophoon in her bosom; [115] the folds of her garment are fragrant, not merely with the incense of Eleusis, but with the natural perfume of flowers and fruit. The sweet breath with which she nourishes the child Demophoon, is the warm west wind, feeding all germs of vegetable life; her bosom, where he lies, is the bosom of the earth, with its strengthening heat, reserved and shy, offended if human eyes scrutinise too closely its secret chemistry; it is with the earth's natural surface of varied colour that she has, \"in time past, given pleasure to the sun\"; the yellow hair which falls suddenly over her shoulders, at her transformation in the house of Celeus, is still partly the golden corn;--in art and poetry she is ever the blond goddess; tarrying in her temple, of which an actual hollow in the earth is the prototype, among the spicy odours of the Eleusinian ritual, she is the spirit of the earth, lying hidden in its dark folds until the return of spring, among the flower-seeds and fragrant roots, like the seeds and aromatic woods hidden in the wrappings of the dead. Throughout the poem, we have a sense of a certain nearness to nature, surviving from an earlier world; the sea is understood as a person, yet is still the real sea, with the waves moving. When it is said that no bird gave Demeter tidings of Persephone, we feel that to that earlier world, ways of communication between all creatures may have seemed open, which are closed to us. It is Iris who brings to Demeter the message of Zeus; [116] that is, the rainbow signifies to the earth the good-will of the rainy sky towards it. Persephone springing up with great joy from the couch of Aidoneus, to return to her mother, is the sudden outburst of the year. The heavy and narcotic aroma of spring flowers hangs about her, as about the actual spring. And this mingling of the primitive cosmical import of the myth with the later, personal interests of the story, is curiously illustrated by the place which the poem assigns to Hecate. This strange Titaness is, first, a nymph only; afterwards, as if changed incurably by the passionate cry of Persephone, she becomes her constant attendant, and is even identified with her. But in the Homeric hymn her lunar character is clear; she is really the moon only, who hears the cry of Persephone, as the sun saw her, when Aidoneus carried her away. One morning, as the mother wandered, the moon appeared, as it does in its last quarter, rising very bright, just before dawn; that is, in the words of the Homeric hymn--\"on the tenth morning Hecate met her, having a light in her hands.\" The fascinating, but enigmatical figure, \"sitting ever in her cave, half-veiled with a shining veil, thinking delicate thoughts,\" in which we seem to see the subject of some picture of the Italian Renaissance, is but the lover of Endymion-- like Persephone, withdrawn, in her season, from the eyes of men. The sun saw her; the moon saw her not, but heard her cry, and is [117] ever after the half-veiled attendant of the queen of dreams and of the dead. But the story of Demeter and Persephone lends itself naturally to description, and it is in descriptive beauties that the Homeric hymn excels; its episodes are finished designs, and directly stimulate the painter and the sculptor to a rivalry with them. Weaving the names of the flowers into his verse, names familiar to us in English, though their Greek originals are uncertain, the writer sets Persephone before us, herself like one of them--kalykôpis+--like the budding calyx of a flower,--in a picture, which, in its mingling of a quaint freshness and simplicity with a certain earnestness, reads like a description of some early Florentine design, such as Sandro Botticelli's Allegory of the Seasons. By an exquisite chance also, a common metrical expression connects the perfume of the newly-created narcissus with the salt odour of the sea. Like one of those early designs also, but with a deeper infusion of religious earnestness, is the picture of Demeter sitting at the wayside, in shadow as always, with the well of water and the olive-tree. She has been journeying all night, and now it is morning, and the daughters of Celeus bring their vessels to draw water. That image of the seated Demeter, resting after her long flight \"through the dark continent,\" or in the house of Celeus, when she refuses the red wine, or again, solitary, in her newly-finished [118] temple of Eleusis, enthroned in her grief, fixed itself deeply on the Greek imagination, and became a favourite subject of Greek artists. When the daughters of Celeus come to conduct her to Eleusis, they come as in a Greek frieze, full of energy and motion and waving lines, but with gold and colours upon it. Eleusis--coming--the coming of Demeter thither, as thus told in the Homeric hymn, is the central instance in Greek mythology of such divine appearances. \"She leaves for a season the company of the gods and abides among men;\" and men's merit is to receive her in spite of appearances. Metaneira and others, in the Homeric hymn, partly detect her divine character; they find charis+;--a certain gracious air--about her, which makes them think her, perhaps, a royal person in disguise. She becomes in her long wanderings almost wholly humanised, and in return, she and Persephone, alone of the Greek gods, seem to have been the objects of a sort of personal love and loyalty. Yet they are ever the solemn goddesses,--theai semnai,+ the word expressing religious awe, the Greek sense of the divine presence. Plato, in laying down the rules by which the poets are to be guided in speaking about divine things to the citizens of the ideal republic, forbids all those episodes of mythology which represent the gods as assuming various forms, and visiting the earth in disguise. Below the [119] express reasons which he assigns for this rule, we may perhaps detect that instinctive antagonism to the old Heraclitean philosophy of perpetual change, which forces him, in his theory of morals and the state, of poetry and music, of dress and manners even, and of style in the very vessels and furniture of daily life, on an austere simplicity, the older Dorian or Egyptian type of a rigid, eternal immobility. The disintegrating, centrifugal influence, which had penetrated, as he thought, political and social existence, making men too myriad-minded, had laid hold on the life of the gods also, and, even in their calm sphere, one could hardly identify a single divine person as himself, and not another. There must, then, be no doubling, no disguises, no stories of transformation. The modern reader, however, will hardly acquiesce in this \"improvement\" of Greek mythology. He finds in these stories, like that, for instance, of the appearance of Athene to Telemachus, in the first book of the Odyssey, which has a quite biblical mysticity and solemnity,--stories in which, the hard material outline breaking up, the gods lay aside their visible form like a garment, yet remain essentially themselves,--not the least spiritual element of Greek religion, an evidence of the sense therein of unseen presences, which might at any moment cross a man's path, to be recognised, in half disguise, by the more delicately trained eye, here or there, by one and not by [120] another. Whatever religious elements they lacked, they had at least this sense of subtler and more remote ways of personal presence. And as there are traces in the Homeric hymn of the primitive cosmical myth, relics of the first stage of the development of the story, so also many of its incidents are probably suggested by the circumstances and details of the Eleusinian ritual. There were religious usages before there were distinct religious conceptions, and these antecedent religious usages shape and determine, at many points, the ultimate religious conception, as the details of the myth interpret or explain the religious custom. The hymn relates the legend of certain holy places, to which various impressive religious rites had attached themselves--the holy well, the old fountain, the stone of sorrow, which it was the office of the \"interpreter\" of the holy places to show to the people. The sacred way which led from Athens to Eleusis was rich in such memorials. The nine days of the wanderings of Demeter in the Homeric hymn are the nine days of the duration of the greater or autumnal mysteries; the jesting of the old woman Iambe, who endeavours to make Demeter smile, are the customary mockeries with which the worshippers, as they rested on the bridge, on the seventh day of the feast, assailed those who passed by. The torches in the hands of Demeter are borrowed from the same source; and the shadow in which she is [121] constantly represented, and which is the peculiar sign of her grief, is partly ritual, and a relic of the caves of the old Chthonian worship, partly poetical-- expressive, half of the dark earth to which she escapes from Olympus, half of her mourning. She appears consistently, in the hymn, as a teacher of rites, transforming daily life, and the processes of life, into a religious solemnity. With no misgiving as to the proprieties of a mere narration, the hymn-writer mingles these symbolical imitations with the outlines of the original story; and, in his Demeter, the dramatic person of the mysteries mixes itself with the primitive mythical figure. And the worshipper, far from being offended by these interpolations, may have found a special impressiveness in them, as they linked continuously its inner sense with the outward imagery of the ritual. And, as Demeter and her story embodied themselves gradually in the Greek imagination, so these mysteries in which her worship found its chief expression, grew up little by little, growing always in close connexion with the modifications of the story, sometimes prompting them, at other times suggested by them. That they had a single special author is improbable, and a mere invention of the Greeks, ignorant of their real history and the general analogy of such matters. Here again, as in the story itself, the idea of development, of degrees, of a slow [122] and natural growth, impeded here, diverted there, is the illuminating thought which earlier critics lacked. \"No tongue may speak of them,\" says the Homeric hymn; and the secret has certainly been kept. The antiquarian, dealing, letter by letter, with what is recorded of them, has left few certain data for the reflexion of the modern student of the Greek religion; and of this, its central solemnity, only a fragmentary picture can be made. It is probable that these mysteries developed the symbolical significance of the story of the descent into Hades, the coming of Demeter to Eleusis, the invention of Persephone. They may or may not have been the vehicle of a secret doctrine, but were certainly an artistic spectacle, giving, like the mysteries of the middle age, a dramatic representation of the sacred story,--perhaps a detailed performance, perhaps only such a conventional representation, as was afforded for instance by the medieval ceremonies of Palm Sunday; the whole, probably, centering in an image of Demeter--the work of Praxiteles or his school, in ivory and gold. There is no reason to suppose any specific difference between the observances of the Eleusinian festival and the accustomed usages of the Greek religion; nocturns, libations, quaint purifications, processions--are common incidents of all Greek worship; in all religious ceremonies there is an element of dramatic symbolism; and what we really do see, through those scattered notices, [123] are things which have their parallels in a later age, the whole being not altogether unlike a modern pilgrimage. The exposition of the sacred places--the threshing-floor of Triptolemus, the rocky seat on which Demeter had rested in her sorrow, the well of Callichorus--is not so strange, as it would seem, had it no modern illustration. The libations, at once a watering of the vines and a drink-offering to the dead--still needing men's services, waiting for purification perhaps, or thirsting, like Dante's Adam of Brescia, in their close homes--must, to almost all minds, have had a certain natural impressiveness; and a parallel has sometimes been drawn between this festival and All Souls' Day. And who, everywhere, has not felt the mystical influence of that prolonged silence, the mystic silence, from which the very word \"mystery\" has its origin? Something also there undoubtedly was, which coarser minds might misunderstand. On one day, the initiated went in procession to the sea-coast, where they underwent a purification by bathing in the sea. On the fifth night there was the torchlight procession; and, by a touch of real life in him, we gather from the first page of Plato's Republic that such processions were popular spectacles, having a social interest, so that people made much of attending them. There was the procession of the sacred basket filled with poppy-seeds and pomegranates. There was the day of rest, after [124] the stress and excitement of the \"great night.\" On the sixth day, the image of Iacchus, son of Demeter, crowned with myrtle and having a torch in its hand, was carried in procession, through thousands of spectators, along the sacred way, amid joyous shouts and songs. We have seen such processions; we understand how many different senses, and how lightly, various spectators may put on them; how little definite meaning they may have even for those who officiate in them. Here, at least, there was the image itself, in that age, with its close connexion between religion and art, presumably fair. Susceptibility to the impressions of religious ceremonial must always have varied with the peculiarities of individual temperament, as it varies in our own day; and Eleusis, with its incense and sweet singing, may have been as little interesting to the outward senses of some worshippers there, as the stately and affecting ceremonies of the medieval church to many of its own members. In a simpler yet profounder sense than has sometimes been supposed, these things were really addressed to the initiated only.* We have to travel a long way from the Homeric hymn to the hymn of Callimachus, who writes in the end of Greek literature, in the third century before Christ, in celebration of the procession of the sacred basket of Demeter, not [125] at the Attic, but at the Alexandrian Eleusinia. He developes, in something of the prosaic spirit of a medieval writer of \"mysteries,\" one of the burlesque incidents of the story, the insatiable hunger which seized on Erysichthon because he cut down a grove sacred to the goddess. Yet he finds his opportunities for skilful touches of poetry;--\"As the four white horses draw her sacred basket,\" he says, \"so will the great goddess bring us a white spring, a white summer.\" He describes the grove itself, with its hedge of trees, so thick that an arrow could hardly pass through, its pines and fruit-trees and tall poplars within, and the water, like pale gold, running from the conduits. It is one of those famous poplars that receives the first stroke; it sounds heavily to its companion trees, and Demeter perceives that her sacred grove is suffering. Then comes one of those transformations which Plato will not allow. Vainly anxious to save the lad from his ruin, she appears in the form of a priestess, but with the long hood of the goddess, and the poppy in her hand; and there is something of a real shudder, some still surviving sense of a haunting presence in the groves, in the verses which describe her sudden revelation, when the workmen flee away, leaving their axes in the cleft trees. Of the same age as the hymn of Callimachus, but with very different qualities, is the idyll of Theocritus on the Shepherds' Journey. Although it is possible to define an epoch in mythological [126] development in which literary and artificial influences began to remodel the primitive, popular legend, yet still, among children, and unchanging childlike people, we may suppose that that primitive stage always survived, and the old, instinctive influences were still at work. As the subject of popular religious celebrations also, the myth was still the property of the people, and surrendered to its capricious action. The shepherds in Theocritus, on their way to celebrate one of the more homely feasts of Demeter, about the time of harvest, are examples of these childlike people; the age of the poets has long since come, but they are of the older and simpler order, lingering on in the midst of a more self-conscious world. In an idyll, itself full of the delightful gifts of Demeter, Theocritus sets them before us; through the blazing summer day's journey, the smiling image of the goddess is always before them; and now they have reached the end of their journey:-- \"So I, and Eucritus, and the fair Amyntichus, turned aside into the house of Phrasidamus, and lay down with delight in beds of sweet tamarisk and fresh cuttings from the vines, strewn on the ground. Many poplars and elm-trees were waving over our heads, and not far off the running of the sacred water from the cave of the nymphs warbled to us; in the shimmering branches the sun-burnt grasshoppers were busy with their talk, and from afar the little owl cried softly, out of [127] the tangled thorns of the blackberry; the larks were singing and the hedge-birds, and the turtle-dove moaned; the bees flew round and round the fountains, murmuring softly; the scent of late summer and of the fall of the year was everywhere; the pears fell from the trees at our feet, and apples in number rolled down at our sides, and the young plum-trees were bent to the earth with the weight of their fruit. The wax, four years old, was loosed from the heads of the wine-jars. O! nymphs of Castalia, who dwell on the steeps of Parnassus, tell me, I pray you, was it a draught like this that the aged Chiron placed before Hercules, in the stony cave of Pholus? Was it nectar like this that made the mighty shepherd on Anapus' shore, Polyphemus, who flung the rocks upon Ulysses' ships, dance among his sheepfolds?--A cup like this ye poured out now upon the altar of Demeter, who presides over the threshing-floor. May it be mine, once more, to dig my big winnowing-fan through her heaps of corn; and may I see her smile upon me, holding poppies and handfuls of corn in her two hands!\" Some of the modifications of the story of Demeter, as we find it in later poetry, have been supposed to be due, not to the genuine action of the Greek mind, but to the influence of that so-called Orphic literature, which, in the generation succeeding Hesiod, brought, from Thessaly and Phrygia, a tide of mystical ideas into the Greek [128] religion, sometimes, doubtless, confusing the clearness and naturalness of its original outlines, but also sometimes imparting to them a new and peculiar grace. Under the influence of this Orphic poetry, Demeter was blended, or identified, with Rhea Cybele, the mother of the gods, the wilder earth-goddess of Phrygia; and the romantic figure of Dionysus Zagreus, Dionysus the Hunter, that most interesting, though somewhat melancholy variation on the better known Dionysus, was brought, as son or brother of Persephone, into her circle, the mystical vine, who, as Persephone descends and ascends from the earth, is rent to pieces by the Titans every year and remains long in Hades, but every spring-time comes out of it again, renewing his youth. This identification of Demeter with Rhea Cybele is the motive which has inspired a beautiful chorus in the Helena-- the new Helena--of Euripides, that great lover of all subtle refinements and modernisms, who, in this play, has worked on a strange version of the older story, which relates that Helen had never really gone to Troy at all, but sent her soul only there, apart from her sweet body, which abode all that time in Egypt, at the court of King Proteus, where she is found at last by her husband Menelaus, so that the Trojan war was about a phantom, after all. The chorus has even less than usual to do with the action of the play, being linked to it only by a sort of parallel, which may be understood, [129] between Menelaus seeking Helen, and Demeter seeking Persephone. Euripides, then, takes the matter of the Homeric hymn into the region of a higher and swifter poetry, and connects it with the more stimulating imagery of the Idaean mother. The Orphic mysticism or enthusiasm has been admitted into the story, which is now full of excitement, the motion of rivers, the sounds of the Bacchic cymbals heard over the mountains, as Demeter wanders among the woody valleys seeking her lost daughter, all directly expressed in the vivid Greek words. Demeter is no longer the subdued goddess of the quietly- ordered fields, but the mother of the gods, who has her abode in the heights of Mount Ida, who presides over the dews and waters of the white springs, whose flocks feed, not on grain, but on the curling tendrils of the vine, both of which she withholds in her anger, and whose chariot is drawn by wild beasts, fruit and emblem of the earth in its fiery strength. Not Hecate, but Pallas and Artemis, in full armour, swift-footed, vindicators of chastity, accompany her in her search for Persephone, who is already expressly, korê arrêtos+--\"the maiden whom none may name.\" When she rests from her long wanderings, it is into the stony thickets of Mount Ida, deep with snow, that she throws herself, in her profound grief. When Zeus desires to end her pain, the Muses and the \"solemn\" Graces are sent to dance and sing before her. It is then [130] that Cypris, the goddess of beauty, and the original cause, therefore, of her distress, takes into her hands the brazen tambourines of the Dionysiac worship with their Chthonian or deep-noted sound; and it is she, not the old Iambe, who with this wild music, heard thus for the first time, makes Demeter smile at last. \"Great,\" so the chorus ends with a picture, \"great is the power of the stoles of spotted fawn-skins, and the green leaves of ivy twisted about the sacred wands, and the wheeling motion of the tambourine whirled round in the air, and the long hair floating unbound in honour of Bromius, and the nocturns of the goddess, when the moon looks full upon them.\" The poem of Claudian on the Rape of Proserpine, the longest extant work connected with the story of Demeter, yet itself unfinished, closes the world of classical poetry. Writing in the fourth century of the Christian era, Claudian has his subject before him in the whole extent of its various development, and also profits by those many pictorial representations of it, which, from the famous picture of Polygnotus downwards, delighted the ancient world. His poem, then, besides having an intrinsic charm, is valuable for some reflexion in it of those lost works, being itself pre-eminently a work in colour, and excelling in a kind of painting in words, which brings its subject very pleasantly almost to the eye of the reader. The mind of this late votary [131] of the old gods, in a world rapidly changing, is crowded with all the beautiful forms generated by mythology, and now about to be forgotten. In this after-glow of Latin literature, lighted up long after their fortune had set, and just before their long night began, they pass before us, in his verses, with the utmost clearness, like the figures in an actual procession. The nursing of the infant Sun and Moon by Tethys; Proserpine and her companions gathering flowers at early dawn, when the violets are drinking in the dew, still lying white upon the grass; the image of Pallas winding the peaceful blossoms about the steel crest of her helmet; the realm of Proserpine, softened somewhat by her coming, and filled with a quiet joy; the matrons of Elysium crowding to her marriage toilet, with the bridal veil of yellow in their hands; the Manes, crowned with ghostly flowers yet warmed a little, at the marriage feast; the ominous dreams of the mother; the desolation of the home, like an empty bird's-nest or an empty fold, when she returns and finds Proserpine gone, and the spider at work over her unfinished embroidery; the strangely-figured raiment, the flowers in the grass, which were once blooming youths, having both their natural colour and the colour of their poetry in them, and the clear little fountain there, which was once the maiden Cyane;--all this is shown in a series of descriptions, like the designs in some unwinding tapestry, like Proserpine's own [132] embroidery, the description of which is the most brilliant of these pictures, and, in its quaint confusion of the images of philosophy with those of mythology, anticipates something of the fancy of the Italian Renaissance. \"Proserpina, filling the house soothingly with her low song, was working a gift against the return of her mother, with labour all to be in vain. In it, she marked out with her needle the houses of the gods and the series of the elements, showing by what law, nature, the parent of all, settled the strife of ancient times, and the seeds of things disparted into their places; the lighter elements are borne aloft, the heavier fall to the centre; the air grows bright with heat, a blazing light whirls round the firmament; the sea flows; the earth hangs suspended in its place. And there were divers colours in it; she illuminated the stars with gold, infused a purple shade into the water, and heightened the shore with gems of flowers; and, under her skilful hand, the threads, with their inwrought lustre, swell up, in momentary counterfeit of the waves; you might think that the sea- wind flapped against the rocks, and that a hollow murmur came creeping over the thirsty sands. She puts in the five zones, marking with a red ground the midmost zone, possessed by burning heat; its outline was parched and stiff; the threads seemed thirsty with the constant sunshine; on either side lay the two zones proper for human life, [133] where a gentle temperance reigns; and at the extremes she drew the twin zones of numbing cold, making her work dun and sad with the hues of perpetual frost. She paints in, too, the sacred places of Dis, her father's brother, and the Manes, so fatal to her; and an omen of her doom was not wanting; for, as she worked, as if with foreknowledge of the future, her face became wet with a sudden burst of tears. And now, in the utmost border of the tissue, she had begun to wind in the wavy line of the river Oceanus, with its glassy shallows; but the door sounds on its hinges, and she perceives the goddesses coming; the unfinished work drops from her hands, and a ruddy blush lights up in her clear and snow-white face.\" I have reserved to the last what is perhaps the daintiest treatment of this subject in classical literature, the account of it which Ovid gives in the Fasti--a kind of Roman Calendar--for the seventh of April, the day of the games of Ceres. He tells over again the old story, with much of which, he says, the reader will be already familiar; but he has something also of his own to add to it, which the reader will hear for the first time; and, like one of those old painters who, in depicting a scene of Christian history, drew from their own fancy or experience its special setting and accessories, he translates the story into something very different from the Homeric hymn. The writer of the Homeric [134] hymn had made Celeus a king, and represented the scene at Eleusis in a fair palace, like the Venetian painters who depict the persons of the Holy Family with royal ornaments. Ovid, on the other hand, is more like certain painters of the early Florentine school, who represent the holy persons amid the more touching circumstances of humble life; and the special something of his own which he adds, is a pathos caught from homely things, not without a delightful, just perceptible, shade of humour even, so rare in such work. All the mysticism has disappeared; but, instead, we trace something of that \"worship of sorrow,\" which has been sometimes supposed to have had no place in classical religious sentiment. In Ovid's well-finished elegiacs, Persephone's flower-gathering, the Anthology, reaches its utmost delicacy; but I give the following episode for the sake of its pathetic expression. \"After many wanderings Ceres was come to Attica. There, in the utmost dejection, for the first time, she sat down to rest on a bare stone, which the people of Attica still call the stone of sorrow. For many days she remained there motionless, under the open sky, heedless of the rain and of the frosty moonlight. Places have their fortunes; and what is now the illustrious town of Eleusis was then the field of an old man named Celeus. He was carrying home a load of acorns, and wild berries shaken down from the [135] brambles, and dry wood for burning on the hearth; his little daughter was leading two goats home from the hills; and at home there was a little boy lying sick in his cradle. 'Mother,' said the little girl--and the goddess was moved at the name of mother--'what do you, all alone, in this solitary place?' The old man stopped too, in spite of his heavy burden, and bade her take shelter in his cottage, though it was but a little one. But at first she refused to come; she looked like an old woman, and an old woman's coif confined her hair; and as the man still urged her, she said to him, 'Heaven bless you; and may children always be yours! My daughter has been stolen from me. Alas! how much happier is your lot than mine'; and, though weeping is impossible for the gods, as she spoke, a bright drop, like a tear, fell into her bosom. Soft-hearted, the little girl and the old man weep together. And after that the good man said, 'Arise! despise not the shelter of my little home; so may the daughter whom you seek be restored to you.' 'Lead me,' answered the goddess; 'you have found out the secret of moving me;' and she arose from the stone, and followed the old man; and as they went he told her of the sick child at home--how he is restless with pain, and cannot sleep. And she, before entering the little cottage, gathered from the untended earth the soothing and sleep-giving poppy; and as she gathered it, it is said that she [136] forgot her vow, and tasted of the seeds, and broke her long fast, unaware. As she came through the door, she saw the house full of trouble, for now there was no more hope of life for the sick boy. She saluted the mother, whose name was Metaneira, and humbly kissed the lips of the child, with her own lips; then the paleness left its face, and suddenly the parents see the strength returning to its body; so great is the force that comes from the divine mouth. And the whole family was full of joy--the mother and the father and the little girl; they were the whole household.* Three profound ethical conceptions, three impressive sacred figures, have now defined themselves for the Greek imagination, condensed from all the traditions which have now been traced, from the hymns of the poets, from the instinctive and unformulated mysticism of primitive minds. Demeter is become the divine sorrowing mother. Kore, the goddess of summer, is become Persephone, the goddess of death, still associated with the forms and odours of flowers and fruit, yet as one risen from the dead also, presenting one side of her ambiguous nature to men's gloomier fancies. Thirdly, there is the image of Demeter enthroned, chastened by sorrow, and somewhat advanced in age, blessing the earth, in her joy at the return of Kore. The myth has [137] now entered on the third phase of its life, in which it becomes the property of those more elevated spirits, who, in the decline of the Greek religion, pick and choose and modify, with perfect freedom of mind, whatever in it may seem adapted to minister to their culture. In this way, the myths of the Greek religion become parts of an ideal, visible embodiments of the susceptibilities and intuitions of the nobler kind of souls; and it is to this latest phase of mythological development that the highest Greek sculpture allies itself. Its function is to give visible aesthetic expression to the constituent parts of that ideal. As poetry dealt chiefly with the incidents of the story, so it is with the personages of the story--with Demeter and Kore themselves--that sculpture has to do. For the myth of Demeter, like the Greek religion in general, had its unlovelier side, grotesque, unhellenic, unglorified by art, illustrated well enough by the description Pausanias gives us of his visit to the cave of the Black Demeter at Phigalia. In his time the image itself had vanished; but he tells us enough about it to enable us to realise its general characteristics, monstrous as the special legend with which it was connected, the black draperies, the horse's head united to the woman's body, with the carved reptiles creeping about it. If, with the thought of this gloomy image of our mother the earth, in our minds, we take up one of those coins [138] which bear the image of Kore or Demeter,* we shall better understand what the function of sculpture really was, in elevating and refining the religious conceptions of the Greeks. Looking on the profile, for instance, on one of those coins of Messene, which almost certainly represent Demeter, and noting the crisp, chaste opening of the lips, the minutely wrought earrings, and the delicately touched ears of corn,--this trifling object being justly regarded as, in its aesthetic qualities, an epitome of art on a larger scale,--we shall see how far the imagination of the Greeks had travelled from what their Black Demeter shows us had once been possible for them, and in making the gods of their worship the objects of a worthy companionship in their thoughts. Certainly, the mind of the old workman who struck that coin was, if we may trust the testimony of his work, unclouded by impure or gloomy shadows. The thought of Demeter is impressed here, with all the purity and proportion, the purged and dainty intelligence of the human countenance. The mystery of it is indeed absent, perhaps could hardly have been looked for in so slight a thing, intended for no sacred purpose, and tossed lightly from hand to hand. But in his firm hold on the harmonies of the human face, the designer of this tranquil head of [139] Demeter is on the one road to a command over the secrets of all imaginative pathos and mystery; though, in the perfect fairness and blitheness of his work, he might seem almost not to have known the incidents of her terrible story. It is probable that, at a later period than in other equally important temples of Greece, the earlier archaic representation of Demeter in the sanctuary of Eleusis, was replaced by a more beautiful image in the new style, with face and hands of ivory, having therefore, in tone and texture, some subtler likeness to women's flesh, and the closely enveloping drapery being constructed in daintily beaten plates of gold. Praxiteles seems to have been the first to bring into the region of a freer artistic handling these shy deities of the earth, shrinking still within the narrow restraints of a hieratic, conventional treatment, long after the more genuine Olympians had broken out of them. The school of Praxiteles, as distinguished from that of Pheidias, is especially the school of grace, relaxing a little the severe ethical tension of the latter, in favour of a slightly Asiatic sinuosity and tenderness. Pausanias tells us that he carved the two goddesses for the temple of Demeter at Athens; and Pliny speaks of two groups of his in brass, the one representing the stealing of Persephone, the other her later, annual descent into Hades, conducted thither by the now pacified mother. All alike have perished; though perhaps some [140] more or less faint reflexion of the most important of these designs may still be traced on many painted vases which depict the stealing of Persephone,--a helpless, plucked flower in the arms of Aidoneus. And in this almost traditional form, the subject was often represented, in low relief, on tombs, some of which still remain; in one or two instances, built up, oddly enough, in the walls of Christian churches. On the tombs of women who had died in early life, this was a favourite subject, some likeness of the actual lineaments of the deceased being sometimes transferred to the features of Persephone. Yet so far, it might seem, when we consider the interest of this story in itself, and its importance in the Greek religion, that no adequate expression of it had remained to us in works of art. But in the year 1857, the discovery of the marbles, in the sacred precinct of Demeter at Cnidus, restored to us an illustration of the myth in its artistic phase, hardly less central than the Homeric hymn in its poetical phase. With the help of the descriptions and plans of Mr. Newton's book,* we can form, as one always wishes to do in such cases, a clear idea of the place where these marbles--three statues of the best style of Greek sculpture, now in the British Museum--were found. Occupying a ledge of rock, looking towards the sea, at the base of a [141] cliff of upheaved limestone, of singular steepness and regularity of surface, the spot presents indications of volcanic disturbance, as if a chasm in the earth had opened here. It was this character, suggesting the belief in an actual connexion with the interior of the earth (local tradition claiming it as the scene of the stealing of Persephone), which probably gave rise, as in other cases where the landscape presented some peculiar feature in harmony with the story, to the dedication upon it of a house and an image of Demeter, with whom were associated Kore and \"the gods with Demeter\"-- hoi theoi para Damatri+--Aidoneus, and the mystical or Chthonian Dionysus. The house seems to have been a small chapel only, of simple construction, and designed for private use, the site itself having been private property, consecrated by a particular family, for their own religious uses, although other persons, servants or dependents of the founders, may also have frequented it. The architecture seems to have been insignificant, but the sculpture costly and exquisite, belonging, if contemporary with the erection of the building, to a great period of Greek art, of which also it is judged to possess intrinsic marks--about the year 350 before Christ, the probable date of the dedication of the little temple. The artists by whom these works were produced were, therefore, either the contemporaries of Praxiteles, whose Venus was for many centuries the glory of [142] Cnidus, or belonged to the generation immediately succeeding him. The temple itself was probably thrown down by a renewal of the volcanic disturbances; the statues however remaining, and the ministers and worshippers still continuing to make shift for their sacred business in the place, now doubly venerable, but with its temple unrestored, down to the second or third century of the Christian era, its frequenters being now perhaps mere chance comers, the family of the original donors having become extinct, or having deserted it. Into this later arrangement, clearly divined by Mr. Newton, through those faint indications which mean much for true experts, the extant remains, as they were found upon the spot, permit us to enter. It is one of the graves of that old religion, but with much still fresh in it. We see it with its provincial superstitions, and its curious magic rites, but also with its means of really solemn impressions, in the culminating forms of Greek art; the two faces of the Greek religion confronting each other here, and the whole having that rare peculiarity of a kind of personal stamp upon it, the place having been designed to meet the fancies of one particular soul, or at least of one family. It is always difficult to bring the every- day aspect of Greek religion home to us; but even the slighter details of this little sanctuary help us to do this; and knowing so little, as we do, of the greater mysteries of [143] Demeter, this glance into an actual religious place dedicated to her, and with the air of her worship still about it, is doubly interesting. The little votive figures of the goddesses, in baked earth, were still lying stored in the small treasury intended for such objects, or scattered about the feet of the images, together with lamps in great number, a lighted lamp being a favourite offering, in memory of the torches with which Demeter sought Persephone, or from some sense of inherent darkness in these gods of the earth; those torches in the hands of Demeter being indeed originally the artificial warmth and brightness of lamp and fire, on winter nights. The dirae or spells,--katadesmoi+- -binding or devoting certain persons to the infernal gods, inscribed on thin rolls of lead, with holes, sometimes, for hanging them up about those quiet statues, still lay, just as they were left, anywhere within the sacred precinct, illustrating at once the gloomier side of the Greek religion in general, and of Demeter and Persephone especially, in their character of avenging deities, and as relics of ancient magic, reproduced so strangely at other times and places, reminding us of the permanence of certain odd ways of human thought. A woman binds with her spell the person who seduces her husband away from her and her children; another, the person who has accused her of preparing poison for her husband; another devotes one who has not restored a borrowed [144] garment, or has stolen a bracelet, or certain drinking-horns; and, from some instances, we might infer that this was a favourite place of worship for the poor and ignorant. In this living picture, we find still lingering on, at the foot of the beautiful Greek marbles, that phase of religious temper which a cynical mind might think a truer link of its unity and permanence than any higher aesthetic instincts--a phase of it, which the art of sculpture, humanising and refining man's conceptions of the unseen, tended constantly to do away. For the higher side of the Greek religion, thus humanised and refined by art, and elevated by it to the sense of beauty, is here also. There were three ideal forms, as we saw, gradually shaping themselves in the development of the story of Demeter, waiting only for complete realisation at the hands of the sculptor; and now, with these forms in our minds, let us place ourselves in thought before the three images which once probably occupied the three niches or ambries in the face of that singular cliff at Cnidus, one of them being then wrought on a larger scale. Of the three figures, one probably represents Persephone, as the goddess of the dead; the second, Demeter enthroned; the third is probably a portrait-statue of a priestess of Demeter, but may perhaps, even so, represent Demeter herself, Demeter Achaea, Ceres Deserta, the mater dolorosa of the Greeks, a type not as yet [145] recognised in any other work of ancient art. Certainly, it seems hard not to believe that this work is in some way connected with the legend of the place to which it belonged, and the main subject of which it realises so completely; and, at least, it shows how the higher Greek sculpture would have worked out this motive. If Demeter at all, it is Demeter the seeker,--Dêô+--as she was called in the mysteries, in some pause of her restless wandering over the world in search of the lost child, and become at last an abstract type of the wanderer. The Homeric hymn, as we saw, had its sculptural motives, the great gestures of Demeter, who was ever the stately goddess, as she followed the daughters of Celeus, or sat by the well-side, or went out and in, through the halls of the palace, expressed in monumental words. With the sentiment of that monumental Homeric presence this statue is penetrated, uniting a certain solemnity of attitude and bearing, to a profound piteousness, an unrivalled pathos of expression. There is something of the pity of Michelangelo's mater dolorosa, in the wasted form and marred countenance, yet with the light breaking faintly over it from the eyes, which, contrary to the usual practice in ancient sculpture, are represented as looking upwards. It is the aged woman who has escaped from pirates, who has but just escaped being sold as a slave, calling on the young for pity. The sorrows of her long wanderings seem to have passed into the marble; [146] and in this too, it meets the demands which the reader of the Homeric hymn, with its command over the resources of human pathos, makes upon the sculptor. The tall figure, in proportion above the ordinary height, is veiled, and clad to the feet in the longer tunic, its numerous folds hanging in heavy parallel lines, opposing the lines of the peplus, or cloak, which cross it diagonally over the breast, enwrapping the upper portion of the body somewhat closely. It is the very type of the wandering woman, going grandly, indeed, as Homer describes her, yet so human in her anguish, that we seem to recognise some far descended shadow of her, in the homely figure of the roughly clad French peasant woman, who, in one of Corot's pictures, is hasting along under a sad light, as the day goes out behind the little hill. We have watched the growth of the merely personal sentiment in the story; and we may notice that, if this figure be indeed Demeter, then the conception of her has become wholly humanised; no trace of the primitive cosmical import of the myth, no colour or scent of the mystical earth, remains about it. The seated figure, much mutilated, and worn by long exposure, yet possessing, according to the best critics, marks of the school of Praxiteles, is almost undoubtedly the image of Demeter enthroned. Three times in the Homeric hymn she is represented as sitting, once by the fountain at the wayside, again in the house of Celeus, and [147] again in the newly finished temple of Eleusis; but always in sorrow; seated on the petra agelastos,+ which, as Ovid told us, the people of Attica still called the stone of sorrow. Here she is represented in her later state of reconciliation, enthroned as the glorified mother of all things. The delicate plaiting of the tunic about the throat, the formal curling of the hair, and a certain weight of over-thoughtfulness in the brows, recall the manner of Leonardo da Vinci, a master, one of whose characteristics is a very sensitive expression of the sentiment of maternity. It reminds one especially of a work by one of his scholars, the Virgin of the Balances, in the Louvre, a picture which has been thought to represent, under a veil, the blessing of universal nature, and in which the sleepy-looking heads, with a peculiar grace and refinement of somewhat advanced life in them, have just this half-weary posture. We see here, then, the Here of the world below, the Stygian Juno, the chief of those Elysian matrons who come crowding, in the poem of Claudian, to the marriage toilet of Proserpine, the goddess of the fertility of the earth and of all creatures, but still of fertility as arisen out of death;* and therefore she is not without a certain pensiveness, having seen the seed fall into the ground and die, many times. Persephone is returned to her, and the hair [148] spreads, like a rich harvest, over her shoulders; but she is still veiled, and knows that the seed must fall into the ground again, and Persephone descend again from her. The statues of the supposed priestess, and of the enthroned Demeter, are of more than the size of life; the figure of Persephone is but seventeen inches high, a daintily handled toy of Parian marble, the miniature copy perhaps of a much larger work, which might well be reproduced on a magnified scale. The conception of Demeter is throughout chiefly human, and even domestic, though never without a hieratic interest, because she is not a goddess only, but also a priestess. In contrast, Persephone is wholly unearthly, the close companion, and even the confused double, of Hecate, the goddess of midnight terrors,--Despoena,--the final mistress of all that lives; and as sorrow is the characteristic sentiment of Demeter, so awe of Persephone. She is compact of sleep, and death, and flowers, but of narcotic flowers especially,--a revenant, who in the garden of Aidoneus has eaten of the pomegranate, and bears always the secret of decay in her, of return to the grave, in the mystery of those swallowed seeds; sometimes, in later work, holding in her hand the key of the great prison-house, but which unlocks all secrets also; (there, finally, or through oracles revealed in dreams;) sometimes, like Demeter, the poppy, emblem of sleep and death by its [149] narcotic juices, of life and resurrection by its innumerable seeds, of the dreams, therefore, that may intervene between falling asleep and waking. Treated as it is in the Homeric hymn, and still more in this statue, the image of Persephone may be regarded as the result of many efforts to lift the old Chthonian gloom, still lingering on in heavier souls, concerning the grave, to connect it with impressions of dignity and beauty, and a certain sweetness even; it is meant to make men in love, or at least at peace, with death. The Persephone of Praxiteles' school, then, is Aphrodite-Persephone, Venus-Libitina. Her shadowy eyes have gazed upon the fainter colouring of the under- world, and the tranquillity, born of it, has \"passed into her face\"; for the Greek Hades is, after all, but a quiet, twilight place, not very different from that House of Fame where Dante places the great souls of the classical world; Aidoneus himself being conceived, in the highest Greek sculpture, as but a gentler Zeus, the great innkeeper; so that when a certain Greek sculptor had failed in his portraiture of Zeus, because it had too little hilarity, too little, in the eyes and brow, of the open and cheerful sky, he only changed its title, and the thing passed excellently, with its heavy locks and shadowy eyebrows, for the god of the dead. The image of Persephone, then, as it is here composed, with the tall, tower-like head-dress, from which the veil depends--the corn-basket, [150] originally carried thus by the Greek women, balanced on the head--giving the figure unusual length, has the air of a body bound about with grave- clothes; while the archaic hands and feet, and a certain stiffness in the folds of the drapery, give it something of a hieratic character, and to the modern observer may suggest a sort of kinship with the more chastened kind of Gothic work. But quite of the school of Praxiteles is the general character of the composition; the graceful waving of the hair, the fine shadows of the little face, of the eyes and lips especially, like the shadows of a flower--a flower risen noiselessly from its dwelling in the dust--though still with that fulness or heaviness in the brow, as of sleepy people, which, in the delicate gradations of Greek sculpture, distinguish the infernal deities from their Olympian kindred. The object placed in the hand may be, perhaps, a stiff, archaic flower, but is probably the partly consumed pomegranate--one morsel gone; the most usual emblem of Persephone being this mystical fruit, which, because of the multitude of its seeds, was to the Romans a symbol of fecundity, and was sold at the doors of the temple of Ceres, that the women might offer it there, and bear numerous children; and so, to the middle age, became a symbol of the fruitful earth itself; and then of that other seed sown in the dark under-world; and at last of that whole hidden region, so thickly sown, which Dante visited, Michelino painting him, [151] in the Duomo of Florence, with this fruit in his hand, and Botticelli putting it into the childish hands of Him, who, if men \"go down into hell, is there also.\" There is an attractiveness in these goddesses of the earth, akin to the influence of cool places, quiet houses, subdued light, tranquillising voices. What is there in this phase of ancient religion for us, at the present day? The myth of Demeter and Persephone, then, illustrates the power of the Greek religion as a religion of pure ideas--of conceptions, which having no link on historical fact, yet, because they arose naturally out of the spirit of man, and embodied, in adequate symbols, his deepest thoughts concerning the conditions of his physical and spiritual life, maintained their hold through many changes, and are still not without a solemnising power even for the modern mind, which has once admitted them as recognised and habitual inhabitants; and, abiding thus for the elevation and purifying of our sentiments, long after the earlier and simpler races of their worshippers have passed away, they may be a pledge to us of the place in our culture, at once legitimate and possible, of the associations, the conceptions, the imagery, of Greek religious poetry in general, of the poetry of all religions.

HIPPOLYTUS VEILED: A STUDY FROM EURIPIDES [152] CENTURIES of zealous archaeology notwithstanding, many phases of the so varied Greek genius are recorded for the modern student in a kind of shorthand only, or not at all. Even for Pausanias, visiting Greece before its direct part in affairs was quite played out, much had perished or grown dim--of its art, of the truth of its outward history, above all of its religion as a credible or practicable thing. And yet Pausanias visits Greece under conditions as favourable for observation as those under which later travellers, Addison or Eustace, proceed to Italy. For him the impress of life in those old Greek cities is not less vivid and entire than that of medieval Italy to ourselves; at Siena, for instance, with its ancient palaces still in occupation, its public edifices as serviceable as if the old republic had but just now vacated them, the tradition of their primitive worship still unbroken in its churches. Had the opportunities in which Pausanias was [153] fortunate been ours, how many haunts of the antique Greek life unnoticed by him we should have peeped into, minutely systematic in our painstaking! how many a view would broaden out where he notes hardly anything at all on his map of Greece! One of the most curious phases of Greek civilisation which has thus perished for us, and regarding which, as we may fancy, we should have made better use of that old traveller's facilities, is the early Attic deme-life--its picturesque, intensely localised variety, in the hollow or on the spur of mountain or sea-shore; and with it many a relic of primitive religion, many an early growth of art parallel to what Vasari records of artistic beginnings in the smaller cities of Italy. Colonus and Acharnae, surviving still so vividly by the magic of Sophocles, of Aristophanes, are but isolated examples of a widespread manner of life, in which, amid many provincial peculiarities, the first, yet perhaps the most costly and telling steps were made in all the various departments of Greek culture. Even in the days of Pausanias, Piraeus was still traceable as a distinct township, once the possible rival of Athens, with its little old covered market by the seaside, and the symbolical picture of the place, its Genius, visible on the wall. And that is but the type of what there had been to know of threescore and more village communities, each having its own altars, its special worship and [154] place of civic assembly, its trade and crafts, its name drawn from physical peculiarity or famous incident, its body of heroic tradition. Lingering on while Athens, the great deme, gradually absorbed into itself more and more of their achievements, and passing away almost completely as political factors in the Peloponnesian war, they were still felt, we can hardly doubt, in the actual physiognomy of Greece. That variety in unity, which its singular geographical formation secured to Greece as a whole, was at its utmost in these minute reflexions of the national character, with all the relish of local difference--new art, new poetry, fresh ventures in political combination, in the conception of life, springing as if straight from the soil, like the thorn-blossom of early spring in magic lines over all that rocky land. On the other hand, it was just here that ancient habits clung most tenaciously--that old-fashioned, homely, delightful existence, to which the refugee, pent up in Athens in the years of the Peloponnesian war, looked back so fondly. If the impression of Greece generally is but enhanced by the littleness of the physical scene of events intellectually so great--such a system of grand lines, restrained within so narrow a compass, as in one of its fine coins--still more would this be true of those centres of country life. Here, certainly, was that assertion of seemingly small interests, which brings into free play, and gives his utmost value [155] to, the individual; making his warfare, equally with his more peaceful rivalries, deme against deme, the mountain against the plain, the sea-shore, (as in our own old Border life, but played out here by wonderfully gifted people) tangible as a personal history, to the doubling of its fascination for those whose business is with the survey of the dramatic side of life. As with civil matters, so it was also, we may fairly suppose, with religion; the deme-life was a manifestation of religious custom and sentiment, in all their primitive local variety. As Athens, gradually drawing into itself the various elements of provincial culture, developed, with authority, the central religious position, the demes-men did but add the worship of Athene Polias, the goddess of the capital, to their own pre-existent ritual uses. Of local and central religion alike, time and circumstance had obliterated much when Pausanias came. A devout spirit, with religion for his chief interest, eager for the trace of a divine footstep, anxious even in the days of Lucian to deal seriously with what had counted for so much to serious men, he has, indeed, to lament that \"Pan is dead\":-- \"They come no longer!\"--\"These things happen no longer!\" But the Greek--his very name also, Hellen, was the title of a priesthood--had been religious abundantly, sanctifying every detail of his actual life with the religious idea; and as Pausanias goes on his way he finds many a remnant of that [156] earlier estate of religion, when, as he fancied, it had been nearer the gods, as it was certainly nearer the earth. It is marked, even in decay, with varieties of place; and is not only continuous but in situ. At Phigaleia he makes his offerings to Demeter, agreeably to the paternal rites of the inhabitants, wax, fruit, undressed wool \"still full of the sordes of the sheep.\" A dream from heaven cuts short his notice of the mysteries of Eleusis. He sees the stone, \"big enough for a little man,\" on which Silenus was used to sit and rest; at Athens, the tombs of the Amazons, of the purple-haired Nisus, of Deucalion;--\"it is a manifest token that he had dwelt there.\" The worshippers of Poseidon, even at his temple among the hills, might still feel the earth fluctuating beneath their feet. And in care for divine things, he tells us, the Athenians outdid all other Greeks. Even in the days of Nero it revealed itself oddly; and it is natural to suppose that of this temper the demes, as the proper home of conservatism, were exceptionally expressive. Scattered in those remote, romantic villages, among their olives or sea-weeds, lay the heroic graves, the relics, the sacred images, often rude enough amid the delicate tribute of later art; this too oftentimes finding in such retirement its best inspirations, as in some Attic Fiesole. Like a network over the land of gracious poetic tradition, as also of undisturbed ceremonial usage surviving late for those who cared to seek it, the [157] local religions had been never wholly superseded by the worship of the great national temples. They were, in truth, the most characteristic developments of a faith essentially earth-born or indigenous. And how often must the student of fine art, again, wish he had the same sort of knowledge about its earlier growth in Greece, that he actually possesses in the case of Italian art! Given any development at all in this matter, there must have been phases of art, which, if immature, were also veritable expressions of power to come, intermediate discoveries of beauty, such as are by no means a mere anticipation, and of service only as explaining historically larger subsequent achievements, but of permanent attractiveness in themselves, being often, indeed, the true maturity of certain amiable artistic qualities. And in regard to Greek art at its best--the Parthenon--no less than to the art of the Renaissance at its best-- the Sistine Chapel--the more instructive light would be derived rather from what precedes than what follows such central success, from the determination to apprehend the fulfilment of past effort rather than the eve of decline, in the critical, central moment which partakes of both. Of such early promise, early achievement, we have in the case of Greek art little to compare with what is extant of the youth of the arts in Italy. Overbeck's careful gleanings of its history form indeed [158] a sorry relic as contrasted with Vasari's intimations of the beginnings of the Renaissance. Fired by certain fragments of its earlier days, of a beauty, in truth, absolute, and vainly longing for more, the student of Greek sculpture indulges the thought of an ideal of youthful energy therein, yet withal of youthful self-restraint; and again, as with survivals of old religion, the privileged home, he fancies, of that ideal must have been in those venerable Attic townships, as to a large extent it passed away with them. The budding of new art, the survival of old religion, at isolated centres of provincial life, where varieties of human character also were keen, abundant, asserted in correspondingly effective incident-- this is what irresistible fancy superinduces on historic details, themselves meagre enough. The sentiment of antiquity is indeed a characteristic of all cultivated people, even in what may seem the freshest ages, and not exclusively a humour of our later world. In the earliest notices about them, as we know, the people of Attica appear already impressed by the immense antiquity of their occupation of its soil, of which they claim to be the very first flower. Some at least of those old demes-men we may well fancy sentimentally reluctant to change their habits, fearful of losing too much of themselves in the larger stream of life, clinging to what is antiquated as the work of centralisation goes on, needful as that work was, [159] with the great \"Eastern difficulty\" already ever in the distance. The fear of Asia, barbaric, splendid, hardly known, yet haunting the curious imagination of those who had borrowed thence the art in which they were rapidly excelling it, developing, as we now see, in the interest of Greek humanity, crafts begotten of tyrannic and illiberal luxury, was finally to suppress the rivalries of those primitive centres of activity, when the \"invincible armada\" of the common foe came into sight. At a later period civil strife was to destroy their last traces. The old hoplite, from Rhamnus or Acharnae, pent up in beleaguered Athens during that first summer of the Peloponnesian war, occupying with his household a turret of the wall, as Thucydides describes--one of many picturesque touches in that severe historian--could well remember the ancient provincial life which this conflict with Sparta was bringing to an end. He could recall his boyish, half-scared curiosity concerning those Persian ships, coming first as merchantmen, or with pirates on occasion, in the half-savage, wicked splendours of their decoration, the monstrous figure-heads, their glittering freightage. Men would hardly have trusted their women or children with that suspicious crew, hovering through the dusk. There were soothsayers, indeed, who had long foretold what happened soon after, giving shape to vague, supernatural terrors. And then he had crept [160] from his hiding-place with other lads to go view the enemies' slain at Marathon, beside those belated Spartans, this new war with whom seemed to be reviving the fierce local feuds of his younger days. Paraloi and Diacrioi had ever been rivals. Very distant it all seemed now, with all the stories he could tell; for in those crumbling little towns, as heroic life had lingered on into the actual, so, at an earlier date, the supernatural into the heroic. Like mist at dawn, the last traces of its divine visitors had then vanished from the land, where, however, they had already begotten \"our best and oldest families.\" It was Theseus, uncompromising young master of the situation, in fearless application of \"the modern spirit\" of his day to every phase of life where it was applicable, who, at the expense of Attica, had given Athens a people, reluctant enough, in truth, as Plutarch suggests, to desert \"their homes and religious usages and many good and gracious kings of their own\" for this elect youth, who thus figures, passably, as a kind of mythic shorthand for civilisation, making roads and the like, facilitating travel, suppressing various forms of violence, but many innocent things as well. So it must needs be in a world where, even hand in hand with a god-assisted hero, Justice goes blindfold. He slays the bull of Marathon and many another local tyrant, but also exterminates that delightful creature, the Centaur. The Amazon, whom Plato will [161] reinstate as the type of improved womanhood, has no better luck than Phaea, the sow-pig of Crommyon, foul old landed-proprietress. They exerted, however, the prerogative of poetic protest, and survive thereby. Centaur and Amazon, as we see them in the fine art of Greece, represent the regret of Athenians themselves for something that could never be brought to life again, and have their pathos. Those young heroes contending with Amazons on the frieze of the Mausoleum had best make haste with their bloody work, if young people's eyes can tell a true story. A type still of progress triumphant through injustice, set on improving things off the face of the earth, Theseus took occasion to attack the Amazons in their mountain home, not long after their ruinous conflict with Hercules, and hit them when they were down. That greater bully had laboured off on the world's highway, carrying with him the official girdle of Antiope, their queen, gift of Ares, and therewith, it would seem, the mystic secret of their strength. At sight of this new foe, at any rate, she came to a strange submission. The savage virgin had turned to very woman, and was presently a willing slave, returning on the gaily appointed ship in all haste to Athens, where in supposed wedlock she bore King Theseus a son. With their annual visit--visit to the Gargareans!--for the purpose of maintaining their [162] species, parting with their boys early, these husbandless women could hardly be supposed a very happy, certainly not a very joyous people. They figure rather as a sorry measure of the luck of the female sex in taking a hard natural law into their own hands, and by abnegation of all tender companionship making shift with bare independence, as a kind of second-best--the best practicable by them in the imperfect actual condition of things. But the heart-strings would ache still where the breast had been cut away. The sisters of Antiope had come, not immediately, but in careful array of battle, to bring back the captive. All along the weary roads from the Caucasus to Attica, their traces had remained in the great graves of those who died by the way. Against the little remnant, carrying on the fight to the very midst of Athens, Antiope herself had turned, all other thoughts transformed now into wild idolatry of her hero. Superstitious, or in real regret, the Athenians never forgot their tombs. As for Antiope, the conscience of her perfidy remained with her, adding the pang of remorse to her own desertion, when King Theseus, with his accustomed bad faith to women, set her, too, aside in turn. Phaedra, the true wife, was there, peeping suspiciously at her arrival; and even as Antiope yielded to her lord's embraces the thought had come that a male child might be the instrument of her anger, and one day judge her cause. [163] In one of these doomed, decaying villages, then, King Theseus placed the woman and her babe, hidden, yet secure, within the Attic border, as men veil their mistakes or crimes. They might pass away, they and their story, together with the memory of other antiquated creatures of such places, who had had connubial dealings with the stars. The white, paved waggon-track, a by-path of the sacred way to Eleusis, zigzagged through sloping olive-yards, from the plain of silvered blue, with Athens building in the distance, and passed the door of the rude stone house, furnished scantily, which no one had ventured to inhabit of late years till they came there. On the ledges of the grey cliffs above, the laurel groves, stem and foliage of motionless bronze, had spread their tents. Travellers bound northwards were glad to repose themselves there, and take directions, or provision for their journey onwards, from the highland people, who came down hither to sell their honey, their cheese, and woollen stuff, in the tiny market-place. At dawn the great stars seemed to halt a while, burning as if for sacrifice to some pure deity, on those distant, obscurely named heights, like broken swords, the rim of the world. A little later you could just see the newly opened quarries, like streaks of snow on their russet-brown bosoms. Thither in spring-time all eyes turned from Athens devoutly, intent till the first shaft of lightning gave signal for the departure of the [164] sacred ship to Delos. Racing over those rocky surfaces, the virgin air descended hither with the secret of profound sleep, as the child lay in its cubicle hewn in the stone, the white fleeces heaped warmly round him. In the wild Amazon's soul, to her surprise, and at first against her will, the maternal sense had quickened from the moment of his conception, and (that burst of angry tears with which she had received him into the world once dried up), kindling more eagerly at every token of manly growth, had at length driven out every other feeling. And this animal sentiment, educating the human hand and heart in her, had become a moral one, when, King Theseus leaving her in anger, visibly unkind, the child had crept to her side, and tracing with small fingers the wrinkled lines of her woebegone brow, carved there as if by a thousand years of sorrow, had sown between himself and her the seed of an undying sympathy. She was thus already on the watch for a host of minute recognitions on his part, of the self-sacrifice involved in her devotion to a career of which she must needs drain out the sorrow, careful that he might taste only the joy. So far, amid their spare living, the child, as if looking up to the warm broad wing of her love above him, seemed replete with comfort. Yet in his moments of childish sickness, the first passing shadows upon the deep joy of her motherhood, she teaches him betimes to soothe [165] or cheat pain-- little bodily pains only, hitherto. She ventures sadly to assure him of the harsh necessities of life: \"Courage, child! Every one must take his share of suffering. Shift not thy body so vehemently. Pain, taken quietly, is easier to bear.\" Carefully inverting the habits of her own rude childhood, she learned to spin the wools, white and grey, to clothe and cover him pleasantly. The spectacle of his unsuspicious happiness, though at present a matter of purely physical conditions, awoke a strange sense of poetry, a kind of artistic sense in her, watching, as her own long-deferred recreation in life, his delight in the little delicacies she prepared to his liking--broiled kids' flesh, the red wine, the mushrooms sought through the early dew--his hunger and thirst so daintily satisfied, as he sat at table, like the first-born of King Theseus, with two wax-lights and a fire at dawn or nightfall dancing to the prattle and laughter, a bright child, never stupidly weary. At times his very happiness would seem to her like a menace of misfortune to come. Was there not with herself the curse of that unsisterly action? and not far from him, the terrible danger of the father's, the step-mother's jealousy, the mockery of those half- brothers to come? Ah! how perilous for happiness the sensibilities which make him so exquisitely happy now! Before they started on their dreadful visit to the Minotaur, says Plutarch, the women told their [166] sons many tales and other things to encourage them; and, even as she had furnished the child betimes with rules for the solace of bodily pain, so now she would have brought her own sad experience into service in precepts for the ejection of its festering power out of any other trouble that might visit him. Already those little disappointments which are as the shadow beside all conscious enjoyment, were no petty things to her, but had for her their pathos, as children's troubles will have, in spite of the longer chance before them. They were as the first steps in a long story of deferred hopes, or anticipations of death itself and the end of them. The gift of Ares gone, the mystic girdle she would fain have transferred to the child, that bloody god of storm and battle, hereditary patron of her house, faded from her thoughts together with the memory of her past life--the more completely, because another familiar though somewhat forbidding deity, accepting certainly a cruel and forbidding worship, was already in possession, and reigning in the new home when she came thither. Only, thanks to some kindly local influence (by grace, say, of its delicate air), Artemis, this other god she had known in the Scythian wilds, had put aside her fierce ways, as she paused awhile on her heavenly course among these ancient abodes of men, gliding softly, mainly through their dreams, with abundance of salutary touches. Full, in truth, of [167] grateful memory of some timely service at human hands! In these highland villages the tradition of celestial visitants clung fondly, of god or hero, belated or misled on long journeys, yet pleased to be among the sons of men, as their way led them up the steep, narrow, crooked street, condescending to rest a little, as one, under some sudden stress not clearly ascertained, had done here, in this very house, thereafter for ever sacred. The place and its inhabitants, of course, had been something bigger in the days of those old mythic hospitalities, unless, indeed, divine persons took kindly the will for the deed--very different, surely, from the present condition of things, for there was little here to detain a delicate traveller, even in the abode of Antiope and her son, though it had been the residence of a king. Hard by stood the chapel of the goddess, who had thus adorned the place with her memories. The priests, indeed, were already departed to Athens, carrying with them the ancient image, the vehicle of her actual presence, as the surest means of enriching the capital at the expense of the country, where she must now make poor shift of the occasional worshipper on his way through these mountain passes. But safely roofed beneath the sturdy tiles of grey Hymettus marble, upon the walls of the little square recess enclosing the deserted pedestal, a series of crowded imageries, in the devout spirit [168] of earlier days, were eloquent concerning her. Here from scene to scene, touched with silver among the wild and human creatures in dun bronze, with the moon's disk around her head, shrouded closely, the goddess of the chase still glided mystically through all the varied incidents of her story, in all the detail of a written book. A book for the delighted reading of a scholar, willing to ponder at leisure, to make his way surely, and understand. Very different, certainly, from the cruel-featured little idol his mother had brought in her bundle--the old Scythian Artemis, hanging there on the wall, side by side with the forgotten Ares, blood-red,--the goddess reveals herself to the lad, poring through the dusk by taper-light, as at once a virgin, necessarily therefore the creature of solitude, yet also as the assiduous nurse of children, and patroness of the young. Her friendly intervention at the act of birth everywhere, her claim upon the nursling, among tame and wild creatures equally, among men as among gods, nay! among the stars (upon the very star of dawn), gave her a breadth of influence seemingly coextensive with the sum of things. Yes! his great mother was in touch with everything. Yet throughout he can but note her perpetual chastity, with pleasurable though half-suspicious wonder at the mystery, he knows not what, involved therein, as though he awoke suddenly in some distant, unexplored region of her person and activity. [169] Why the lighted torch always, and that long straight vesture rolled round so formally? Was it only against the cold of these northern heights? To her, nevertheless, her maternity, her solitude, to this virgin mother, who, with no husband, no lover, no fruit of her own, is so tender to the children of others, in a full heart he devotes himself- -his immaculate body and soul. Dedicating himself thus, he has the sense also that he becomes more entirely than ever the chevalier of his mortal mother, of her sad cause. The devout, diligent hands clear away carefully the dust, the faded relics of her former worship; a worship renewed once more as the sacred spring, set free from encumbrance, in answer to his willing ministries murmurs again under the dim vault in its marble basin, work of primitive Titanic fingers--flows out through its rocky channel, filling the whole township with chaste thoughts of her. Through much labour at length he comes to the veritable story of her birth, like a gift direct from the goddess herself to this loyal soul. There were those in later times who, like Aeschylus, knew Artemis as the daughter not of Leto but of Demeter, according to the version of her history now conveyed to the young Hippolytus, together with some deepened insight into her character. The goddess of Eleusis, on a journey, in the old days when, as Plato says, [170] men lived nearer the gods, finding herself with child by some starry inmate of those high places, had lain down in the rock-hewn cubicle of the inner chamber, and, certainly in sorrow, brought forth a daughter. Here was the secret at once of the genial, all-embracing maternity of this new strange Artemis, and of those more dubious tokens, the lighted torch, the winding-sheet, the arrow of death on the string--of sudden death, truly, which may be thought after all the kindest, as prevenient of all disgraceful sickness or waste in the unsullied limbs. For the late birth into the world of this so shadowy daughter was somehow identified with the sudden passing into Hades of her first-born, Persephone. As he scans those scenes anew, an awful surmise comes to him; his divine patroness moves there as death, surely. Still, however, gratefully putting away suspicion, he seized even in these ambiguous imageries their happier suggestions, satisfied in thinking of his new mother as but the giver of sound sleep, of the benign night, whence--mystery of mysteries!--good things are born softly, from which he awakes betimes for his healthful service to her. Either way, sister of Apollo or sister of Persephone, to him she should be a power of sanity, sweet as the flowers he offered her gathered at dawn, setting daily their purple and white frost against her ancient marbles. There was more certainly than the first breath of day in them. Was there [171] here something of her person, her sensible presence, by way of direct response to him in his early devotion, astir for her sake before the very birds, nesting here so freely, the quail above all, in some privileged connexion with her story still unfathomed by the learned youth? Amid them he too found a voice, and sang articulately the praises of the great goddess. Those more dubious traits, nevertheless, so lightly disposed of by Hippolytus (Hecate thus counting for him as Artemis goddess of health), became to his mother, in the light of her sad experience, the sum of the whole matter. While he drew only peaceful inducements to sleep from that two-sided figure, she reads there a volume of sinister intentions, and liked little this seemingly dead goddess, who could but move among the living banefully, stealing with her night-shade into the day where she had no proper right. The gods had ever had much to do with the shaping of her fortunes and the fortunes of her kindred; and the mortal mother felt nothing less than jealousy from the hour when the lad had first delightedly called her to share his discoveries, and learn the true story (if it were not rather the malicious counterfeit) of the new divine mother to whom he has thus absolutely entrusted himself. Was not this absolute chastity itself a kind of death? She, too, in secret makes her gruesome midnight offering with averted eyes. She dreams one night he is in danger; creeps to his cubicle [172] to see; the face is covered, as he lies, against the cold. She traces the motionless outline, raises the coverlet; with the nice black head deep in the fleecy pillow he is sleeping quietly, he dreams of that other mother gliding in upon the moonbeam, and awaking turns sympathetically upon the living woman, is subdued in a moment to the expression of her troubled spirit, and understands. And when the child departed from her for the first time, springing from his white bed before the dawn, to accompany the elders on their annual visit to the Eleusinian goddess, the after-sense of his wonderful happiness, tranquillising her in spite of herself by its genial power over the actual moment, stirred nevertheless a new sort of anxiety for the future. Her work in life henceforward was defined as a ministry to so precious a gift, in full consciousness of its risk; it became her religion, the centre of her pieties. She missed painfully his continual singing hovering about the place, like the earth itself made audible in all its humanities. Half-selfish for a moment, she prays that he may remain for ever a child, to her solace; welcomes now the promise of his chastity (though chastity were itself a kind of death) as the pledge of his abiding always with her. And these thoughts were but infixed more deeply by the sudden stroke of joy at his return home in ceremonial trim and grown more manly, with much increase of self-confidence in that brief absence among his fellows. [173] For, from the first, the unwelcome child, the outcast, had been successful, with that special good fortune which sometimes attends the outcast. His happiness, his invincible happiness, had been found engaging, perhaps by the gods, certainly by men; and when King Theseus came to take note how things went in that rough life he had assigned them, he felt a half liking for the boy, and bade him come down to Athens and see the sights, partly by way of proof to his already somewhat exacting wife of the difference between the old love and the new as measured by the present condition of their respective offspring. The fine nature, fastidious by instinct, but bred with frugality enough to find the charm of continual surprise in that delicate new Athens, draws, as he goes, the full savour of its novelties; the marbles, the space and finish, the busy gaiety of its streets, the elegance of life there, contrasting with while it adds some mysterious endearment to the thought of his own rude home. Without envy, in hope only one day to share, to win them by kindness, he gazes on the motley garden-plots, the soft bedding, the showy toys, the delicate keep of the children of Phaedra, who turn curiously to their half-brother, venture to touch his long strange gown of homespun grey, like the soft coat of some wild creature who might let one stroke it. Close to their dainty existence for a while, he regards it as from afar; looks forward all day to the lights, the prattle, the laughter, the white [174] bread, like sweet cake to him, of their ordinary evening meal; returns again and again, in spite of himself, to watch, to admire, feeling a power within him to merit the like; finds his way back at last, still light of heart, to his own poor fare, able to do without what he would enjoy so much. As, grateful for his scanty part in things--for the make-believe of a feast in the little white loaves she too has managed to come by, sipping the thin white wine, he touches her dearly, the mother is shocked with a sense of something unearthly in his contentment, while he comes and goes, singing now more abundantly than ever a new canticle to her divine rival. Were things, after all, to go grudgingly with him? Sensible of that curse on herself, with her suspicions of his kinsfolk, of this dubious goddess to whom he has devoted himself, she anticipates with more foreboding than ever his path to be, with or without a wife--her own solitude, or his--the painful heats and cold. She fears even these late successes; it were best to veil their heads. The strong as such had ever been against her and hers. The father came again; noted the boy's growth. Manliest of men, like Hercules in his cloak of lion's skin, he has after all but scant liking, feels, through a certain meanness of soul, scorn for the finer likeness of himself. Might this creature of an already vanishing world, who for all his hard rearing had a manifest distinction of character, one day become his rival, full of [175] loyalty as he was already to the deserted mother? To charming Athens, nevertheless, he crept back, as occasion served, to gaze peacefully on the delightful good fortune of others, waiting for the opportunity to take his own turn with the rest, driving down thither at last in a chariot gallantly, when all the town was assembled to celebrate the king's birthday. For the goddess, herself turning ever kinder, and figuring more and more exclusively as the tender nurse of all things, had transformed her young votary from a hunter into a charioteer, a rearer and driver of horses, after the fashion of his Amazon mothers before him. Thereupon, all the lad's wholesome vanity had centered on the fancy of the world-famous games then lately established, as, smiling down his mother's terrors, and grateful to his celestial mother for many a hair-breadth escape, he practised day by day, fed the animals, drove them out, amused though companionless, visited them affectionately in the deserted stone stables of the ancient king. A chariot and horses, as being the showiest outward thing the world afforded, was like the pawn he moved to represent the big demand he meant to make, honestly, generously, on the ample fortunes of life. There was something of his old miraculous kindred, alien from this busy new world he came to, about the boyish driver with the fame of a scholar, in his grey fleecy cloak and hood of soft [175] white woollen stuff, as he drove in that morning. Men seemed to have seen a star flashing, and crowded round to examine the little mountain-bred beasts, in loud, friendly intercourse with the hero of the hour--even those usually somewhat unsympathetic half-brothers now full of enthusiasm for the outcast and his good fight for prosperity. Instinctively people admired his wonderful placidity, and would fain have shared its secret, as it were the carelessness of some fair flower upon his face. A victor in the day's race, he carried home as his prize a glittering new harness in place of the very old one he had come with. \"My chariot and horses!\" he says now, with his single touch of pride. Yet at home, savouring to the full his old solitary happiness, veiled again from time to time in that ancient life, he is still the student, still ponders the old writings which tell of his divine patroness. At Athens strange stories are told in turn of him, his nights upon the mountains, his dreamy sin, with that hypocritical virgin goddess, stories which set the jealous suspicions of Theseus at rest once more. For so \"dream\" not those who have the tangible, appraisable world in view. Even Queen Phaedra looks with pleasure, as he comes, on the once despised illegitimate creature, at home now here too, singing always audaciously, so visibly happy, occupied, popular. Encompassed by the luxuries of Athens, far from those peaceful mountain places, among people [177] further still in spirit from their peaceful light and shade, he did not forget the kindly goddess, still sharing with his earthly mother the prizes, or what they would buy, for the adornment of their spare abode. The tombs of the fallen Amazons, the spot where they had breathed their last, he piously visited, informed himself of every circumstance of the event with devout care, and, thinking on them amid the dainties of the royal table, boldly brought them too their share of the offerings to the heroic dead. Aphrodite, indeed--Aphrodite, of whom he had scarcely so much as heard--was just then the best-served deity in Athens, with all its new wealth of colour and form, its gold and ivory, the acting, the music, the fantastic women, beneath the shadow of the great walls still rising steadily. Hippolytus would have no part in her worship; instead did what was in him to revive the neglected service of his own goddess, stirring an old jealousy. For Aphrodite too had looked with delight upon the youth, already the centre of a hundred less dangerous human rivalries among the maidens of Greece, and was by no means indifferent to his indifference, his instinctive distaste; while the sterner, almost forgotten Artemis found once more her great moon-shaped cake, set about with starry tapers, at the appointed seasons. They know him now from afar, by his emphatic, shooting, arrowy movements; and on [178] the day of the great chariot races \"he goes in and wins.\" To the surprise of all he compounded his handsome prize for the old wooden image taken from the chapel at home, lurking now in an obscure shrine in the meanest quarter of the town. Sober amid the noisy feasting which followed, unashamed, but travelling by night to hide it from their mockery, warm at his bosom, he reached the passes at twilight, and through the deep peace of the glens bore it to the old resting-place, now more worthy than ever of the presence of its mistress, his mother and all the people of the village coming forth to salute her, all doors set mystically open, as she advances. Phaedra too, his step-mother, a fiery soul with wild strange blood in her veins, forgetting her fears of this illegitimate rival of her children, seemed now to have seen him for the first time, loved at last the very touch of his fleecy cloak, and would fain have had him of her own religion. As though the once neglected child had been another, she tries to win him as a stranger in his manly perfection, growing more than an affectionate mother to her husband's son. But why thus intimate and congenial, she asks, always in the wrong quarter? Why not compass two ends at once? Why so squeamishly neglect the powerful, any power at all, in a city so full of religion? He might find the image of her sprightly goddess everywhere, to his [179] liking, gold, silver, native or stranger, new or old, graceful, or indeed, if he preferred it so, in iron or stone. By the way, she explains the delights of love, of marriage, the husband once out of the way; finds in him, with misgiving, a sort of forwardness, as she thinks, on this one matter, as if he understood her craft and despised it. He met her questions in truth with scarce so much as contempt, with laughing counter-queries, why people needed wedding at all? They might have found the children in the temples, or bought them, as you could buy flowers in Athens. Meantime Phaedra's young children draw from the seemingly unconscious finger the marriage-ring, set it spinning on the floor at his feet, and the staid youth places it for a moment on his own finger for safety. As it settles there, his step-mother, aware all the while, suddenly presses his hand over it. He found the ring there that night as he lay; left his bed in the darkness, and again, for safety, put it on the finger of the image, wedding once for all that so kindly mystical mother. And still, even amid his earthly mother's terrible misgivings, he seems to foresee a charming career marked out before him in friendly Athens, to the height of his desire. Grateful that he is here at all, sharing at last so freely life's banquet, he puts himself for a moment in his old place, recalling his old enjoyment of the pleasure of others; [180] feels, just then, no different. Yet never had life seemed so sufficing as at this moment- -the meat, the drink, the drives, the popularity as he comes and goes, even his step-mother's false, selfish, ostentatious gifts. But she, too, begins to feel something of the jealousy of that other divine, would-be mistress, and by way of a last effort to bring him to a better mind in regard to them both, conducts him (immeasurable privilege!) to her own private chapel. You could hardly tell where the apartments of the adulteress ended and that of the divine courtesan began. Haunts of her long, indolent, self-pleasing nights and days, they presented everywhere the impress of Phaedra's luxurious humour. A peculiar glow, such as he had never before seen, like heady lamplight, or sunshine to some sleeper in a delirious dream, hung upon, clung to, the bold, naked, shameful imageries, as his step-mother trimmed the lamps, drew forth her sickly perfumes, clad afresh in piquant change of raiment the almost formless goddess crouching there in her unclean shrine or stye, set at last her foolish wheel in motion to a low chant, holding him by the wrist, keeping close all the while, as if to catch some germ of consent in his indifferent words. And little by little he perceives that all this is for him--the incense, the dizzy wheel, the shreds of stuff cut secretly from his sleeve, the sweetened cup he drank at her offer, unavailingly;+ [181] and yes! his own features surely, in pallid wax. With a gasp of flighty laughter she ventures to point the thing out to him, full as he is at last of visible, irrepressible dislike. Ah! it was that very reluctance that chiefly stirred her. Healthily white and red, he had a marvellous air of discretion about him, as of one never to be caught unaware, as if he never could be anything but like water from the rock, or the wild flowers of the morning, or the beams of the morning star turned to human flesh. It was the self-possession of this happy mind, the purity of this virgin body, she would fain have perturbed, as a pledge to herself of her own gaudy claim to supremacy. King Theseus, as she knew, had had at least two earlier loves; for once she would be a first love; felt at moments that with this one passion once indulged, it might be happiness thereafter to remain chaste for ever. And then, by accident, yet surely reading indifference in his manner of accepting her gifts, she is ready again for contemptuous, open battle. Is he indeed but a child still, this nursling of the forbidding Amazon, of that Amazonian goddess--to be a child always? or a wily priest rather, skilfully circumventing her sorceries, with mystic precautions of his own? In truth, there is something of the priestly character in this impassible discretion, reminding her of his alleged intimacy with the rival goddess, and redoubling her curiosity, her fondness.+ [182] Phaedra, love-sick, feverish, in bodily sickness at last, raves of the cool woods, the chase, the steeds of Hippolytus, her thoughts running madly on what she fancies to be his secret business; with a storm of abject tears, foreseeing in one moment of recoil the weary tale of years to come, star-stricken as she declares, she dared at last to confess her longing to already half-suspicious attendants; and, awake one morning to find Hippolytus there kindly at her bidding, drove him openly forth in a tempest of insulting speech. There was a mordant there, like the menace of misfortune to come, in which the injured goddess also was invited to concur. What words! what terrible words! following, clinging to him, like acrid fire upon his bare flesh, as he hasted from Phaedra's house, thrust out at last, his vesture remaining in her hands. The husband returning suddenly, she tells him a false story of violence to her bed, and is believed. King Theseus, all his accumulated store of suspicion and dislike turning now to active hatred, flung away readily upon him, bewildered, unheard, one of three precious curses (some mystery of wasting sickness therein) with which Poseidon had indulged him. It seemed sad that one so young must call for justice, precariously, upon the gods, the dead, the very walls! Admiring youth dared hardly bid farewell to their late comrade; are generous, at most, in [183] stolen, sympathetic glances towards the fallen star. At home, veiled once again in that ancient twilight world, his mother, fearing solely for what he may suffer by the departure of that so brief prosperity, enlarged as it had been, even so, by his grateful taking of it, is reassured, delighted, happy once more at the visible proof of his happiness, his invincible happiness. Duly he returned to Athens, early astir, for the last time, to restore the forfeited gifts, drove back his gaily painted chariot to leave there behind him, actually enjoying the drive, going home on foot poorer than ever. He takes again to his former modes of life, a little less to the horses, a little more to the old studies, the strange, secret history of his favourite goddess,--wronged surely! somehow, she too, as powerless to help him; till he lay sick at last, battling one morning, unaware of his mother's presence, with the feverish creations of the brain; the giddy, foolish wheel, the foolish song, of Phaedra's chapel, spinning there with his heart bound thereto. \"The curses of my progenitors are come upon me!\" he cries. \"And yet, why so? guiltless as I am of evil.\" His wholesome religion seeming to turn against him now, the trees, the streams, the very rocks, swoon into living creatures, swarming around the goddess who has lost her grave quietness. He finds solicitation, and recoils, in the wind, in the sounds of the rain; till at length delirium [184] itself finds a note of returning health. The feverish wood-ways of his fancy open unexpectedly upon wide currents of air, lulling him to sleep; and the conflict ending suddenly altogether at its sharpest, he lay in the early light motionless among the pillows, his mother standing by, as she thought, to see him die. As if for the last time, she presses on him the things he had liked best in that eating and drinking she had found so beautiful. The eyes, the eyelids are big with sorrow; and, as he understands again, making an effort for her sake, the healthy light returns into his; a hand seizes hers gratefully, and a slow convalescence begins, the happiest period in the wild mother's life. When he longed for flowers for the goddess, she went a toilsome journey to seek them, growing close, after long neglect, wholesome and firm on their tall stalks. The singing she had longed for so despairingly hovers gaily once more within the chapel and around the house. At the crisis of that strange illness she had supposed her long forebodings about to be realised at last; but upon his recovery feared no more, assured herself that the curses of the father, the step-mother, the concurrent ill-will of that angry goddess, have done their utmost; he will outlive her; a few years hence put her to a rest surely welcome. Her misgivings, arising always out of the actual spectacle of his profound happiness, seemed at an end in this meek bliss, the more as [185] she observed that it was a shade less unconscious than of old. And almost suddenly he found the strength, the heart, in him, to try his fortune again with the old chariot; and those still unsatisfied curses, in truth, going on either side of him like living creatures unseen, legend tells briefly how, a competitor for pity with Adonis, and Icarus, and Hyacinth, and other doomed creatures of immature radiance in all story to come, he set forth joyously for the chariot-races, not of Athens, but of Troezen, her rival. Once more he wins the prize; he says good-bye to admiring friends anxious to entertain him, and by night starts off homewards, as of old, like a child, returning quickly through the solitude in which he had never lacked company, and was now to die. Through all the perils of darkness he had guided the chariot safely along the curved shore; the dawn was come, and a little breeze astir, as the grey level spaces parted delicately into white and blue, when in a moment an earthquake, or Poseidon the earth-shaker himself, or angry Aphrodite awake from the deep betimes, rent the tranquil surface; a great wave leapt suddenly into the placid distance of the Attic shore, and was surging here to the very necks of the plunging horses, a moment since enjoying so pleasantly with him the caress of the morning air, but now, wholly forgetful of their old affectionate habit of obedience, dragging their leader headlong over the rough pavements. [186] Evening and the dawn might seem to have met on that hapless day through which they drew him home entangled in the trappings of the chariot that had been his ruin, till he lay at length, grey and haggard, at the rest he had longed for dimly amid the buffeting of those murderous stones, his mother watching impassibly, sunk at once into the condition she had so long anticipated. Later legend breaks a supernatural light over that great desolation, and would fain relieve the reader by introducing the kindly Asclepius, who presently restores the youth to life, not, however, in the old form or under familiar conditions. To her, surely, counting the wounds, the disfigurements, telling over the pains which had shot through that dear head now insensible to her touch among the pillows under the harsh broad daylight, that would have been no more of a solace than if, according to the fancy of Ovid, he flourished still, a little deity, but under a new name and veiled now in old age, in the haunted grove of Aricia, far from his old Attic home, in a land which had never seen him as he was. THE BEGINNINGS OF GREEK SCULPTURE I: THE HEROIC AGE OF GREEK ART [187] THE extant remains of Greek sculpture, though but a fragment of what the Greek sculptors produced, are, both in number and in excellence, in their fitness, therefore, to represent the whole of which they were a part, quite out of proportion to what has come down to us of Greek painting, and all those minor crafts which, in the Greek workshop, as at all periods when the arts have been really vigorous, were closely connected with the highest imaginative work. Greek painting is represented to us only by its distant reflexion on the walls of the buried houses of Pompeii, and the designs of subordinate though exquisite craftsmen on the vases. Of wrought metal, partly through the inherent usefulness of its material, tempting ignorant persons into whose hands it may fall to re-fashion it, we have comparatively little; while, in consequence of the perishableness of their material, nothing [188] remains of the curious wood-work, the carved ivory, the embroidery and coloured stuffs, on which the Greeks set much store--of that whole system of refined artisanship, diffused, like a general atmosphere of beauty and richness, around the more exalted creations of Greek sculpture. What we possess, then, of that highest Greek sculpture is presented to us in a sort of threefold isolation; isolation, first of all, from the concomitant arts--the frieze of the Parthenon without the metal bridles on the horses, for which the holes in the marble remain; isolation, secondly, from the architectural group of which, with most careful estimate of distance and point of observation, that frieze, for instance, was designed to be a part; isolation, thirdly, from the clear Greek skies, the poetical Greek life, in our modern galleries. And if one here or there, in looking at these things, bethinks himself of the required substitution; if he endeavours mentally to throw them back into that proper atmosphere, through which alone they can exercise over us all the magic by which they charmed their original spectators, the effort is not always a successful one, within the grey walls of the Louvre or the British Museum. And the circumstance that Greek sculpture is presented to us in such falsifying isolation from the work of the weaver, the carpenter, and the goldsmith, has encouraged a manner of regarding it too little sensuous. Approaching it with full [189] information concerning what may be called the inner life of the Greeks, their modes of thought and sentiment amply recorded in the writings of the Greek poets and philosophers, but with no lively impressions of that mere craftsman's world of which so little has remained, students of antiquity have for the most part interpreted the creations of Greek sculpture, rather as elements in a sequence of abstract ideas, as embodiments, in a sort of petrified language, of pure thoughts, and as interesting mainly in connexion with the development of Greek intellect, than as elements of a sequence in the material order, as results of a designed and skilful dealing of accomplished fingers with precious forms of matter for the delight of the eyes. Greek sculpture has come to be regarded as the product of a peculiarly limited art, dealing with a specially abstracted range of subjects; and the Greek sculptor as a workman almost exclusively intellectual, having only a sort of accidental connexion with the material in which his thought was expressed. He is fancied to have been disdainful of such matters as the mere tone, the fibre or texture, of his marble or cedar-wood, of that just perceptible yellowness, for instance, in the ivory-like surface of the Venus of Melos; as being occupied only with forms as abstract almost as the conceptions of philosophy, and translateable it might be supposed into any material--a habit of regarding him still further encouraged by the modern [190] sculptor's usage of employing merely mechanical labour in the actual working of the stone. The works of the highest Greek sculpture are indeed intellectualised, if we may say so, to the utmost degree; the human figures which they present to us seem actually to conceive thoughts; in them, that profoundly reasonable spirit of design which is traceable in Greek art, continuously and increasingly, upwards from its simplest products, the oil-vessel or the urn, reaches its perfection. Yet, though the most abstract and intellectualised of sensuous objects, they are still sensuous and material, addressing themselves, in the first instance, not to the purely reflective faculty, but to the eye; and a complete criticism must have approached them from both sides-- from the side of the intelligence indeed, towards which they rank as great thoughts come down into the stone; but from the sensuous side also, towards which they rank as the most perfect results of that pure skill of hand, of which the Venus of Melos, we may say, is the highest example, and the little polished pitcher or lamp, also perfect in its way, perhaps the lowest. To pass by the purely visible side of these things, then, is not only to miss a refining pleasure, but to mistake altogether the medium in which the most intellectual of the creations of Greek art, the Aeginetan or the Elgin marbles, for instance, were actually produced; even these having, in their origin, depended for much of [191] their charm on the mere material in which they were executed; and the whole black and grey world of extant antique sculpture needing to be translated back into ivory and gold, if we would feel the excitement which the Greek seems to have felt in the presence of these objects. To have this really Greek sense of Greek sculpture, it is necessary to connect it, indeed, with the inner life of the Greek world, its thought and sentiment, on the one hand; but on the other hand to connect it, also, with the minor works of price, intaglios, coins, vases; with that whole system of material refinement and beauty in the outer Greek life, which these minor works represent to us; and it is with these, as far as possible, that we must seek to relieve the air of our galleries and museums of their too intellectual greyness. Greek sculpture could not have been precisely a cold thing; and, whatever a colour-blind school may say, pure thoughts have their coldness, a coldness which has sometimes repelled from Greek sculpture, with its unsuspected fund of passion and energy in material form, those who cared much, and with much insight, for a similar passion and energy in the coloured world of Italian painting. Theoretically, then, we need that world of the minor arts as a complementary background for the higher and more austere Greek sculpture; and, as matter of fact, it is just with such a world--with a period of refined and exquisite [192] tectonics+ (as the Greeks called all crafts strictly subordinate to architecture), that Greek art actually begins, in what is called the Heroic Age, that earliest, undefined period of Greek civilisation, the beginning of which cannot be dated, and which reaches down to the first Olympiad, about the year 776 B.C. Of this period we possess, indeed, no direct history, and but few actual monuments, great or small; but as to its whole character and outward local colouring, for its art, as for its politics and religion, Homer may be regarded as an authority. The Iliad and the Odyssey, the earliest pictures of that heroic life, represent it as already delighting itself in the application of precious material and skilful handiwork to personal and domestic adornment, to the refining and beautifying of the entire outward aspect of life; above all, in the lavish application of very graceful metal-work to such purposes. And this representation is borne out by what little we possess of its actual remains, and by all we can infer. Mixed, of course, with mere fable, as a description of the heroic age, the picture which Homer presents to us, deprived of its supernatural adjuncts, becomes continuously more and more realisable as the actual condition of early art, when we emerge gradually into historical time, and find ourselves at last among dateable works and real schools or masters. The history of Greek art, then, begins, as some have fancied general history to begin, in a [193] golden age, but in an age, so to speak, of real gold, the period of those first twisters and hammerers of the precious metals--men who had already discovered the flexibility of silver and the ductility of gold, the capacity of both for infinite delicacy of handling, and who enjoyed, with complete freshness, a sense of beauty and fitness in their work--a period of which that flower of gold on a silver stalk, picked up lately in one of the graves at Mycenae, or the legendary golden honeycomb of Daedalus, might serve as the symbol. The heroic age of Greek art is the age of the hero as smith. There are in Homer two famous descriptive passages in which this delight in curious metal-work is very prominent; the description in the Iliad of the shield of Achilles* and the description of the house of Alcinous in the Odyssey.* The shield of Achilles is part of the suit of armour which Hephaestus makes for him at the request of Thetis; and it is wrought of variously Coloured metals, woven into a great circular composition in relief, representing the world and the life in it. The various activities of man are recorded in this description in a series of idyllic incidents with such complete freshness, liveliness, and variety, that the reader from time to time may well forget himself, and fancy he is reading a mere description of the incidents of actual life. [194] We peep into a little Greek town, and see in dainty miniature the bride coming from her chamber with torch-bearers and dancers, the people gazing from their doors, a quarrel between two persons in the market-place, the assembly of the elders to decide upon it. In another quartering is the spectacle of a city besieged, the walls defended by the old men, while the soldiers have stolen out and are lying in ambush. There is a fight on the river-bank; Ares and Athene, conspicuous in gold, and marked as divine persons by a scale larger than that of their followers, lead the host. The strange, mythical images of Kêr, Eris, and Kudoimos mingle in the crowd. A third space upon the shield depicts the incidents of peaceful labour--the ploughshare passing through the field, of enameled black metal behind it, and golden before; the cup of mead held out to the ploughman when he reaches the end of the furrow; the reapers with their sheaves; the king standing in silent pleasure among them, intent upon his staff. There are the labourers in the vineyard in minutest detail; stakes of silver on which the vines hang; the dark trench about it, and one pathway through the midst; the whole complete and distinct, in variously coloured metal. All things and living creatures are in their places--the cattle coming to water to the sound of the herdsman's pipe, various music, the rushes by the water-side, a lion-hunt with dogs, [195] the pastures among the hills, a dance, the fair dresses of the male and female dancers, the former adorned with swords, the latter with crowns. It is an image of ancient life, its pleasure and business. For the centre, as in some quaint chart of the heavens, are the earth and the sun, the moon and constellations; and to close in all, right round, like a frame to the picture, the great river Oceanus, forming the rim of the shield, in some metal of dark blue. Still more fascinating, perhaps, because more completely realisable by the fancy as an actual thing--realisable as a delightful place to pass time in--is the description of the palace of Alcinous in the little island town of the Phaeacians, to which we are introduced in all the liveliness and sparkle of the morning, as real as something seen last summer on the sea-coast; although, appropriately, Ulysses meets a goddess, like a young girl carrying a pitcher, on his way up from the sea. Below the steep walls of the town, two projecting jetties allow a narrow passage into a haven of stone for the ships, into which the passer-by may look down, as they lie moored below the roadway. In the midst is the king's house, all glittering, again, with curiously wrought metal; its brightness is \"as the brightness of the sun or of the moon.\" The heart of Ulysses beats quickly when he sees it standing amid plantations ingeniously watered, its floor and walls of brass throughout, with continuous [196] cornice of dark iron; the doors are of gold, the door-posts and lintels of silver, the handles, again, of gold-- The walls were massy brass; the cornice high Blue metals crowned in colours of the sky; Rich plates of gold the folding-doors incase; The pillars silver on a brazen base; Silver the lintels deep-projecting o'er; And gold the ringlets that command the door. Dogs of the same precious metals keep watch on either side, like the lions over the old gate-way of Mycenae, or the gigantic, human-headed bulls at the entrance of an Assyrian palace. Within doors the burning lights at supper-time are supported in the hands of golden images of boys, while the guests recline on a couch running all along the wall, covered with peculiarly sumptuous women's work. From these two glittering descriptions manifestly something must be deducted; we are in wonder-land, and among supernatural or magical conditions. But the forging of the shield and the wonderful house of Alcinous are no merely incongruous episodes in Homer, but the consummation of what is always characteristic of him, a constant preoccupation, namely, with every form of lovely craftsmanship, resting on all things, as he says, like the shining of the sun. We seem to pass, in reading him, through the treasures of some royal collection; in him the presentation of almost every aspect of life is [197] beautified by the work of cunning hands. The thrones, coffers, couches of curious carpentry, are studded with bossy ornaments of precious metal effectively disposed, or inlaid with stained ivory, or blue cyanus, or amber, or pale amber-like gold; the surfaces of the stone conduits, the sea-walls, the public washing-troughs, the ramparts on which the weary soldiers rest themselves when returned to Troy, are fair and smooth; all the fine qualities, in colour and texture, of woven stuff are carefully noted--the fineness, closeness, softness, pliancy, gloss, the whiteness or nectar-like tints in which the weaver delights to work; to weave the sea-purple threads is the appropriate function of queens and noble women. All the Homeric shields are more or less ornamented with variously coloured metal, terrible sometimes, like Leonardo's, with some monster or grotesque. The numerous sorts of cups are bossed with golden studs, or have handles wrought with figures, of doves, for instance. The great brazen cauldrons bear an epithet which means flowery. The trappings of the horses, the various parts of the chariots, are formed of various metals. The women's ornaments and the instruments of their toilet are described-- porpas te gnamptas th' helikas, kalukas te kai hormous+ --the golden vials for unguents. Use and beauty are still undivided; all that men's hands are set to make has still a fascination alike for workmen [198] and spectators. For such dainty splendour Troy, indeed, is especially conspicuous. But then Homer's Trojans are essentially Greeks--Greeks of Asia; and Troy, though more advanced in all elements of civilisation, is no real contrast to the western shore of the Aegean. It is no barbaric world that we see, but the sort of world, we may think, that would have charmed also our comparatively jaded sensibilities, with just that quaint simplicity which we too enjoy in its productions; above all, in its wrought metal, which loses perhaps more than any other sort of work by becoming mechanical. The metal-work which Homer describes in such variety is all hammer-work, all the joinings being effected by pins or riveting. That is just the sort of metal-work which, in a certain naïveté and vigour, is still of all work the most expressive of actual contact with dexterous fingers; one seems to trace in it, on every particle of the partially resisting material, the touch and play of the shaping instruments, in highly trained hands, under the guidance of exquisitely disciplined senses--that cachet, or seal of nearness to the workman's hand, which is the special charm of all good metal-work, of early metal-work in particular. Such descriptions, however, it may be said, are mere poetical ornament, of no value in helping us to define the character of an age. But what is peculiar in these Homeric descriptions, [199] what distinguishes them from others at first sight similar, is a sort of internal evidence they present of a certain degree of reality, signs in them of an imagination stirred by surprise at the spectacle of real works of art. Such minute, delighted, loving description of details of ornament, such following out of the ways in which brass, gold, silver, or paler gold, go into the chariots and armour and women's dress, or cling to the walls--the enthusiasm of the manner-- is the warrant of a certain amount of truth in all that. The Greek poet describes these things with the same vividness and freshness, the same kind of fondness, with which other poets speak of flowers; speaking of them poetically, indeed, but with that higher sort of poetry which seems full of the lively impression of delightful things recently seen. Genuine poetry, it is true, is always naturally sympathetic with all beautiful sensible things and qualities. But with how many poets would not this constant intrusion of material ornament have produced a tawdry effect! The metal would all be tarnished and the edges blurred. And this is because it is not always that the products of even exquisite tectonics can excite or refine the aesthetic sense. Now it is probable that the objects of oriental art, the imitations of it at home, in which for Homer this actual world of art must have consisted, reached him in a quantity, and with a novelty, just sufficient to warm and stimulate without [200] surfeiting the imagination; it is an exotic thing of which he sees just enough and not too much. The shield of Achilles, the house of Alcinous, are like dreams indeed, but this sort of dreaming winds continuously through the entire Iliad and Odyssey--a child's dream after a day of real, fresh impressions from things themselves, in which all those floating impressions re-set themselves. He is as pleased in touching and looking at those objects as his own heroes; their gleaming aspect brightens all he says, and has taken hold, one might think, of his language, his very vocabulary becoming chryselephantine. Homer's artistic descriptions, though enlarged by fancy, are not wholly imaginary, and the extant remains of monuments of the earliest historical age are like lingering relics of that dream in a tamer but real world. The art of the heroic age, then, as represented in Homer, connects itself, on the one side, with those fabulous jewels so prominent in mythological story, and entwined sometimes so oddly in its representation of human fortunes--the necklace of Eriphyle, the necklace of Helen, which Menelaus, it was said, offered at Delphi to Athene Pronoea, on the eve of his expedition against Troy--mythical objects, indeed, but which yet bear witness even thus early to the aesthetic susceptibility of the Greek temper. But, on the other hand, the art of the heroic age connects itself also with the actual early beginnings [201] of artistic production. There are touches of reality, for instance, in Homer's incidental notices of its instruments and processes; especially as regards the working of metal. He goes already to the potter's wheel for familiar, life-like illustration. In describing artistic wood-work he distinguishes various stages of work; we see clearly the instruments for turning and boring, such as the old-fashioned drill-borer, whirled round with a string; he mentions the names of two artists, the one of an actual workman, the other of a craft turned into a proper name--stray relics, accidentally preserved, of a world, as we may believe, of such wide and varied activity. The forge of Hephaestus is a true forge; the magic tripods on which he is at work are really put together by conceivable processes, known in early times. Compositions in relief similar to those which he describes were actually made out of thin metal plates cut into a convenient shape, and then beaten into the designed form by the hammer over a wooden model. These reliefs were then fastened to a differently coloured metal background or base, with nails or rivets, for there is no soldering of metals as yet. To this process the ancients gave the name of empaestik,+ such embossing being still, in our own time, a beautiful form of metal-work. Even in the marvellous shield there are other and indirect notes of reality. In speaking of the shield of Achilles, I departed intentionally from [202] the order in which the subjects of the relief are actually introduced in the Iliad, because, just then, I wished the reader to receive the full effect of the variety and elaborateness of the composition, as a representation or picture of the whole of ancient life embraced within the circumference of a shield. But in the order in which Homer actually describes those episodes he is following the method of a very practicable form of composition, and is throughout much closer than we might at first sight suppose to the ancient armourer's proceedings. The shield is formed of five superimposed plates of different metals, each plate of smaller diameter than the one immediately below it, their flat margins showing thus as four concentric stripes or rings of metal, around a sort of boss in the centre, five metals thick, and the outermost circle or ring being the thinnest. To this arrangement the order of Homer's description corresponds. The earth and the heavenly bodies are upon this boss in the centre, like a little distant heaven hung above the broad world, and from this Homer works out, round and round, to the river Oceanus, which forms the border of the whole; the subjects answering to, or supporting each other, in a sort of heraldic order--the city at peace set over against the city besieged- -spring, summer, and autumn balancing each other--quite congruously with a certain heraldic turn common in contemporary Assyrian art, which delights in [203] this sort of conventional spacing out of its various subjects, and especially with some extant metal chargers of Assyrian work, which, like some of the earliest Greek vases with their painted plants and flowers conventionally arranged, illustrate in their humble measure such heraldic grouping. The description of the shield of Hercules, attributed to Hesiod, is probably an imitation of Homer, and, notwithstanding some fine mythological impersonations which it contains, an imitation less admirable than the original. Of painting there are in Homer no certain indications, and it is consistent with the later date of the imitator that we may perhaps discern in his composition a sign that what he had actually seen was a painted shield, in the pre-dominance in it, as compared with the Homeric description, of effects of colour over effects of form; Homer delighting in ingenious devices for fastening the metal, and the supposed Hesiod rather in what seem like triumphs of heraldic colouring; though the latter also delights in effects of mingled metals, of mingled gold and silver especially-- silver figures with dresses of gold, silver centaurs with pine-trees of gold for staves in their hands. Still, like the shield of Achilles, this too we must conceive as formed of concentric plates of metal; and here again that spacing is still more elaborately carried out, narrower intermediate rings being apparently [204] introduced between the broader ones, with figures in rapid, horizontal, unbroken motion, carrying the eye right round the shield, in contrast with the repose of the downward or inward movement of the subjects which divide the larger spaces; here too with certain analogies in the rows of animals to the designs on the earliest vases. In Hesiod then, as in Homer, there are undesigned notes of correspondence between the partly mythical ornaments imaginatively enlarged of the heroic age, and a world of actual handicrafts. In the shield of Hercules another marvellous detail is added in the image of Perseus, very daintily described as hovering in some wonderful way, as if really borne up by wings, above the surface. And that curious, haunting sense of magic in art, which comes out over and over again in Homer--in the golden maids, for instance, who assist Hephaestus in his work, and similar details which seem at first sight to destroy the credibility of the whole picture, and make of it a mere wonder-land--is itself also, rightly understood, a testimony to a real excellence in the art of Homer's time. It is sometimes said that works of art held to be miraculous are always of an inferior kind; but at least it was not among those who thought them inferior that the belief in their miraculous power began. If the golden images move like living creatures, and the armour of Achilles, so [205] wonderfully made, lifts him like wings, this again is because the imagination of Homer is really under the stimulus of delightful artistic objects actually seen. Only those to whom such artistic objects manifest themselves through real and powerful impressions of their wonderful qualities, can invest them with properties magical or miraculous. I said that the inherent usefulness of the material of metal-work makes the destruction of its acquired form almost certain, if it comes into the possession of people either barbarous or careless of the work of a past time. Greek art is for us, in all its stages, a fragment only; in each of them it is necessary, in a somewhat visionary manner, to fill up empty spaces, and more or less make substitution; and of the finer work of the heroic age, thus dimly discerned as an actual thing, we had at least till recently almost nothing. Two plates of bronze, a few rusty nails, and certain rows of holes in the inner surface of the walls of the \"treasury\" of Mycenae, were the sole representatives of that favourite device of primitive Greek art, the lining of stone walls with burnished metal, of which the house of Alcinous in the Odyssey is the ideal picture, and the temple of Pallas of the Brazen House at Sparta, adorned in the interior with a coating of reliefs in metal, a later, historical example. Of the heroic or so-called Cyclopean architecture, that \"treasury,\" [206] a building so imposing that Pausanias thought it worthy to rank with the Pyramids, is a sufficient illustration. Treasury, or tomb, or both (the selfish dead, perhaps, being supposed still to find enjoyment in the costly armour, goblets, and mirrors laid up there), this dome-shaped building, formed of concentric rings of stones gradually diminishing to a coping-stone at the top, may stand as the representative of some similar buildings in other parts of Greece, and of many others in a similar kind of architecture elsewhere, constructed of large many-sided blocks of stone, fitted carefully together without the aid of cement, and remaining in their places by reciprocal resistance. Characteristic of it is the general tendency to use vast blocks of stone for the jambs and lintels of doors, for instance, and in the construction of gable-shaped passages; two rows of such stones being made to rest against each other at an acute angle, within the thickness of the walls. So vast and rude, fretted by the action of nearly three thousand years, the fragments of this architecture may often seem, at first sight, like works of nature. At Argos, Tiryns, Mycenae, the skeleton of the old architecture is more complete. At Mycenae the gateway of the acropolis is still standing with its two well-known sculptured lions--immemorial and almost unique monument of primitive Greek sculpture--supporting, herald-wise, a symbolical pillar on the [207] vast, triangular, pedimental stone above. The heads are gone, having been fashioned possibly in metal by workmen from the East. On what may be called the façade, remains are still discernible of inlaid work in coloured stone, and within the gateway, on the smooth slabs of the pavement, the wheel-ruts are still visible. Connect them with those metal war-chariots in Homer, and you may see in fancy the whole grandiose character of the place, as it may really have been. Shut within the narrow enclosure of these shadowy citadels were the palaces of the kings, with all that intimacy which we may sometimes suppose to have been alien from the open-air Greek life, admitting, doubtless, below the cover of their rough walls, many of those refinements of princely life which the Middle Age found possible in such places, and of which the impression is so fascinating in Homer's description, for instance, of the house of Ulysses, or of Menelaus at Sparta. Rough and frowning without, these old châteaux of the Argive kings were delicate within with a decoration almost as dainty and fine as the network of weed and flower that now covers their ruins, and of the delicacy of which, as I said, that golden flower on its silver stalk or the golden honeycomb of Daedalus, might be taken as representative. In these metal-like structures of self-supporting polygons, locked so firmly and impenetrably together, with the whole mystery of the reasonableness [208] of the arch implicitly within them, there is evidence of a complete artistic command over weight in stone, and an understanding of the \"law of weight.\" But over weight only; the ornament still seems to be not strictly architectural, but, according to the notices of Homer, tectonic, borrowed from the sister arts, above all from the art of the metal-workers, to whom those spaces of the building are left which a later age fills with painting, or relief in stone. The skill of the Asiatic comes to adorn this rough native building; and it is a late, elaborate, somewhat voluptuous skill, we may understand, illustrated by the luxury of that Asiatic chamber of Paris, less like that of a warrior than of one going to the dance. Coupled with the vastness of the architectural works which actually remain, such descriptions as that in Homer of the chamber of Paris and the house of Alcinous furnish forth a picture of that early period--the tyrants' age, the age of the acropoleis, the period of great dynasties with claims to \"divine right\"' and in many instances at least with all the culture of their time. The vast buildings make us sigh at the thought of wasted human labour, though there is a public usefulness too in some of these designs, such as the draining of the Copaic lake, to which the backs of the people are bent whether they will or not. For the princes there is much of that selfish personal luxury which is a constant trait of feudalism in [209] all ages. For the people, scattered over the country, at their agricultural labour, or gathered in small hamlets, there is some enjoyment, perhaps, of the aspect of that splendour, of the bright warriors on the heights--a certain share of the nobler pride of the tyrants themselves in those tombs and dwellings. Some surmise, also, there seems to have been, of the \"curse\" of gold, with a dim, lurking suspicion of curious facilities for cruelty in the command over those skilful artificers in metal-- some ingenious rack or bull \"to pinch and peel\"--the tradition of which, not unlike the modern Jacques Bonhomme's shudder at the old ruined French donjon or bastille, haunts, generations afterwards, the ruins of those \"labyrinths\" of stone, where the old tyrants had their pleasures. For it is a mistake to suppose that that wistful sense of eeriness in ruined buildings, to which most of us are susceptible, is an exclusively modern feeling. The name Cyclopean, attached to those desolate remains of buildings which were older than Greek history itself, attests their romantic influence over the fancy of the people who thus attributed them to a superhuman strength and skill. And the Cyclopes, like all the early mythical names of artists, have this note of reality, that they are names not of individuals but of classes, the guilds or companies of workmen in which a certain craft was imparted and transmitted. The Dactyli, the Fingers, are the [210] first workers in iron; the savage Chalybes in Scythia the first smelters; actual names are given to the old, fabled Telchines-- Chalkon, Argyron, Chryson--workers in brass, silver, and gold, respectively.+ The tradition of their activity haunts the several regions where those metals were found. They make the trident of Poseidon; but then Poseidon's trident is a real fisherman's instrument, the tunny-fork. They are credited, notwithstanding, with an evil sorcery, unfriendly to men, as poor humanity remembered the makers of chains, locks, Procrustean beds; and, as becomes this dark recondite mine and metal work, the traditions about them are gloomy and grotesque, confusing mortal workmen with demon guilds. To this view of the heroic age of Greek art as being, so to speak, an age of real gold, an age delighting itself in precious material and exquisite handiwork in all tectonic crafts, the recent extraordinary discoveries at Troy and Mycenae are, on any plausible theory of their date and origin, a witness. The aesthetic critic needs always to be on his guard against the confusion of mere curiosity or antiquity with beauty in art. Among the objects discovered at Troy--mere curiosities, some of them, however interesting and instructive--the so-called royal cup of Priam, in solid gold, two-handled and double- lipped, (the smaller lip designed for the host and his libation, the larger for the guest,) has, in the [211] very simplicity of its design, the grace of the economy with which it exactly fulfils its purpose, a positive beauty, an absolute value for the aesthetic sense, while strange and new enough, if it really settles at last a much-debated expression of Homer; while the \"diadem,\" with its twisted chains and flowers of pale gold, shows that those profuse golden fringes, waving so comely as he moved, which Hephaestus wrought for the helmet of Achilles, were really within the compass of early Greek art. And the story of the excavations at Mycenae reads more like some well-devised chapter of fiction than a record of sober facts. Here, those sanguine, half-childish dreams of buried treasure discovered in dead men's graves, which seem to have a charm for every one, are more than fulfilled in the spectacle of those antique kings, lying in the splendour of their crowns and breastplates of embossed plate of gold; their swords, studded with golden imagery, at their sides, as in some feudal monument; their very faces covered up most strangely in golden masks. The very floor of one tomb, we read, was thick with gold- dust--the heavy gilding fallen from some perished kingly vestment; in another was a downfall of golden leaves and flowers; and, amid this profusion of thin fine fragments, were rings, bracelets, smaller crowns as if for children, dainty butterflies for ornaments of dresses, and that golden flower on a silver stalk--all of pure, [212] soft gold, unhardened by alloy, the delicate films of which one must touch but lightly, yet twisted and beaten, by hand and hammer, into wavy, spiral relief, the cuttle-fish with its long undulating arms appearing frequently. It is the very image of the old luxurious life of the princes of the heroic age, as Homer describes it, with the arts in service to its kingly pride. Among the other costly objects was one representing the head of a cow, grandly designed in gold with horns of silver, like the horns of the moon, supposed to be symbolical of Here, the great object of worship at Argos. One of the interests of the study of mythology is that it reflects the ways of life and thought of the people who conceived it; and this religion of Here, the special religion of Argos, is congruous with what has been here said as to the place of art in the civilisation of the Argives; it is a reflexion of that splendid and wanton old feudal life. For Here is, in her original essence and meaning, equivalent to Demeter--the one living spirit of the earth, divined behind the veil of all its manifold visible energies. But in the development of a common mythological motive the various peoples are subject to the general limitations of their life and thought; they can but work outward what is within them; and the religious conceptions and usages, ultimately derivable from one and the same rudimentary instinct, are sometimes most diverse. Out of [213] the visible, physical energies of the earth and its system of annual change, the old Pelasgian mind developed the person of Demeter, mystical and profoundly aweful, yet profoundly pathetic, also, in her appeal to human sympathies. Out of the same original elements, the civilisation of Argos, on the other hand, developes the religion of Queen Here, a mere Demeter, at best, of gaudy flower-beds, whose toilet Homer describes with all its delicate fineries; though, characteristically, he may still allow us to detect, perhaps, some traces of the mystical person of the earth, in the all-pervading scent of the ambrosial unguent with which she anoints herself, in the abundant tresses of her hair, and in the curious variegation of her ornaments. She has become, though with some reminiscence of the mystical earth, a very limited human person, wicked, angry, jealous--the lady of Zeus in her castle-sanctuary at Mycenae, in wanton dalliance with the king, coaxing him for cruel purposes in sweet sleep, adding artificial charms to her beauty. Such are some of the characteristics with which Greek art is discernible in that earliest age. Of themselves, they almost answer the question which next arises--Whence did art come to Greece? or was it a thing of absolutely native growth there? So some have decidedly maintained. Others, who lived in an age possessing little or no knowledge of Greek monuments anterior to the full development of art under [214] Pheidias, and who, in regard to the Greek sculpture of the age of Pheidias, were like people criticising Michelangelo, without knowledge of the earlier Tuscan school--of the works of Donatello and Mino da Fiesole--easily satisfied themselves with theories of its importation ready-made from other countries. Critics in the last century, especially, noticing some characteristics which early Greek work has in common, indeed, with Egyptian art, but which are common also to all such early work everywhere, supposed, as a matter of course, that it came, as the Greek religion also, from Egypt--that old, immemorial half-known birthplace of all wonderful things. There are, it is true, authorities for this derivation among the Greeks themselves, dazzled as they were by the marvels of the ancient civilisation of Egypt, a civilisation so different from their own, on the first opening of Egypt to Greek visitors. But, in fact, that opening did not take place till the reign of Psammetichus, about the middle of the seventh century B.C., a relatively late date. Psammetichus introduced and settled Greek mercenaries in Egypt, and, for a time, the Greeks came very close to Egyptian life. They can hardly fail to have been stimulated by that display of every kind of artistic workmanship gleaming over the whole of life; they may in turn have freshened it with new motives. And we may remark, that but for the peculiar usage of Egypt concerning the tombs of the dead, but [215] for their habit of investing the last abodes of the dead with all the appurtenances of active life, out of that whole world of art, so various and elaborate, nothing but the great, monumental works in stone would have remained to ourselves. We should have experienced in regard to it, what we actually experience too much in our knowledge of Greek art--the lack of a fitting background, in the smaller tectonic work, for its great works in architecture, and the bolder sort of sculpture. But, one by one, at last, as in the medieval parallel, monuments illustrative of the earlier growth of Greek art before the time of Pheidias have come to light, and to a just appreciation. They show that the development of Greek art had already proceeded some way before the opening of Egypt to the Greeks, and point, if to a foreign source at all, to oriental rather than Egyptian influences; and the theory which derived Greek art, with many other Greek things, from Egypt, now hardly finds supporters. In Greece all things are at once old and new. As, in physical organisms, the actual particles of matter have existed long before in other combinations; and what is really new in a new organism is the new cohering force--the mode of life,--so, in the products of Greek civilisation, the actual elements are traceable elsewhere by antiquarians who care to trace them; the elements, for instance, of its peculiar national [216] architecture. Yet all is also emphatically autochthonous, as the Greeks said, new-born at home, by right of a new, informing, combining spirit playing over those mere elements, and touching them, above all, with a wonderful sense of the nature and destiny of man--the dignity of his soul and of his body--so that in all things the Greeks are as discoverers. Still, the original and primary motive seems, in matters of art, to have come from without; and the view to which actual discovery and all true analogies more and more point is that of a connexion of the origin of Greek art, ultimately with Assyria, proximately with Phoenicia, partly through Asia Minor, and chiefly through Cyprus--an original connexion again and again re-asserted, like a surviving trick of inheritance, as in later times it came in contact with the civilisation of Caria and Lycia, old affinities being here linked anew; and with a certain Asiatic tradition, of which one representative is the Ionic style of architecture, traceable all through Greek art--an Asiatic curiousness, or poikilia,+ strongest in that heroic age of which I have been speaking, and distinguishing some schools and masters in Greece more than others; and always in appreciable distinction from the more clearly defined and self-asserted Hellenic influence. Homer himself witnesses to the intercourse, through early, adventurous commerce, as in the bright and animated picture with which [217] the history of Herodotus begins, between the Greeks and Eastern countries. We may, perhaps, forget sometimes, thinking over the greatness of its place in the history of civilisation, how small a country Greece really was; how short the distances upwards, from island to island, to the coast of Asia, so that we can hardly make a sharp separation between Asia and Greece, nor deny, besides great and palpable acts of importation, all sorts of impalpable Asiatic influences, by way alike of attraction and repulsion, upon Greek manners and taste. Homer, as we saw, was right in making Troy essentially a Greek city, with inhabitants superior in all culture to their kinsmen on the Western shore, and perhaps proportionally weaker on the practical or moral side, and with an element of languid Ionian voluptuousness in them, typified by the cedar and gold of the chamber of Paris--an element which the austere, more strictly European influence of the Dorian Apollo will one day correct in all genuine Greeks. The Aegean, with its islands, is, then, a bond of union, not a barrier; and we must think of Greece, as has been rightly said, as its whole continuous shore. The characteristics of Greek art, indeed, in the heroic age, so far as we can discern them, are those also of Phoenician art, its delight in metal among the rest, of metal especially as an element in architecture, the covering of everything with plates of metal. It was from [218] Phoenicia that the costly material in which early Greek art delighted actually came--ivory, amber, much of the precious metals. These the adventurous Phoenician traders brought in return for the mussel which contained the famous purple, in quest of which they penetrated far into all the Greek havens. Recent discoveries present the island of Cyprus, the great source of copper and copper- work in ancient times, as the special mediator between the art of Phoenicia and Greece; and in some archaic figures of Aphrodite with her dove, brought from Cyprus and now in the British Museum--objects you might think, at first sight, taken from the niches of a French Gothic cathedral--are some of the beginnings, at least, of Greek sculpture manifestly under the influence of Phoenician masters. And, again, mythology is the reflex of characteristic facts. It is through Cyprus that the religion of Aphrodite comes from Phoenicia to Greece. Here, in Cyprus, she is connected with some other kindred elements of mythological tradition, above all with the beautiful old story of Pygmalion, in which the thoughts of art and love are connected so closely together. First of all, on the prows of the Phoenician ships, the tutelary image of Aphrodite Euploea, the protectress of sailors, comes to Cyprus--to Cythera; it is in this simplest sense that she is, primarily, Anadyomene.+ And her connexion [219] with the arts is always an intimate one. In Cyprus her worship is connected with an architecture, not colossal, but full of dainty splendour--the art of the shrine-maker, the maker of reliquaries; the art of the toilet, the toilet of Aphrodite; the Homeric hymn to Aphrodite is full of all that; delight in which we have seen to be characteristic of the true Homer. And now we see why Hephaestus, that crook-backed and uncomely god, is the husband of Aphrodite. Hephaestus is the god of fire, indeed; as fire he is flung from heaven by Zeus; and in the marvellous contest between Achilles and the river Xanthus in the twenty-first book of the Iliad, he intervenes in favour of the hero, as mere fire against water. But he soon ceases to be thus generally representative of the functions of fire, and becomes almost exclusively representative of one only of its aspects, its function, namely, in regard to early art; he becomes the patron of smiths, bent with his labour at the forge, as people had seen such real workers; he is the most perfectly developed of all the Daedali, Mulcibers, or Cabeiri. That the god of fire becomes the god of all art, architecture included, so that he makes the houses of the gods, and is also the husband of Aphrodite, marks a threefold group of facts; the prominence, first, of a peculiar kind of art in early Greece, that beautiful metal-work, with [220] which he is bound and bent; secondly, the connexion of this, through Aphrodite, with an almost wanton personal splendour; the connexion, thirdly, of all this with Cyprus and Phoenicia, whence, literally, Aphrodite comes. Hephaestus is the \"spiritual form\" of the Asiatic element in Greek art. This, then, is the situation which the first period of Greek art comprehends; a people whose civilisation is still young, delighting, as the young do, in ornament, in the sensuous beauty of ivory and gold, in all the lovely productions of skilled fingers. They receive all this, together with the worship of Aphrodite, by way of Cyprus, from Phoenicia, from the older, decrepit Eastern civilisation, itself long since surfeited with that splendour; and they receive it in frugal quantity, so frugal that their thoughts always go back to the East, where there is the fulness of it, as to a wonder-land of art. Received thus in frugal quantity, through many generations, that world of Asiatic tectonics stimulates the sensuous capacity in them, accustoms the hand to produce and the eye to appreciate the more delicately enjoyable qualities of material things. But nowhere in all this various and exquisite world of design is there as yet any adequate sense of man himself, nowhere is there an insight into or power over human form as the expression of human soul. Yet those arts of design in which that younger people delights [221] have in them already, as designed work, that spirit of reasonable order, that expressive congruity in the adaptation of means to ends, of which the fully developed admirableness of human form is but the consummation-- a consummation already anticipated in the grand and animated figures of epic poetry, their power of thought, their laughter and tears. Under the hands of that younger people, as they imitate and pass largely and freely beyond those older craftsmen, the fire of the reasonable soul will kindle, little by little, up to the Theseus of the Parthenon and the Venus of Melos. The ideal aim of Greek sculpture, as of all other art, is to deal, indeed, with the deepest elements of man's nature and destiny, to command and express these, but to deal with them in a manner, and with a kind of expression, as clear and graceful and simple, if it may be, as that of the Japanese flower-painter. And what the student of Greek sculpture has to cultivate generally in himself is the capacity for appreciating the expression of thought in outward form, the constant habit of associating sense with soul, of tracing what we call expression to its sources. But, concurrently with this, he must also cultivate, all along, a not less equally constant appreciation of intelligent workmanship in work, and of design in things designed, of the rational control of matter everywhere. From many sources he may feed this sense of intelligence [222] and design in the productions of the minor crafts, above all in the various and exquisite art of Japan. Carrying a delicacy like that of nature itself into every form of imitation, reproduction, and combination-- leaf and flower, fish and bird, reed and water--and failing only when it touches the sacred human form, that art of Japan is not so unlike the earliest stages of Greek art as might at first sight be supposed. We have here, and in no mere fragments, the spectacle of a universal application to the instruments of daily life of fitness and beauty, in a temper still unsophisticated, as also unelevated, by the divination of the spirit of man. And at least the student must always remember that Greek art was throughout a much richer and warmer thing, at once with more shadows, and more of a dim magnificence in its surroundings, than the illustrations of a classical dictionary might induce him to think. Some of the ancient temples of Greece were as rich in aesthetic curiosities as a famous modern museum. That Asiatic poikilia,+ that spirit of minute and curious loveliness, follows the bolder imaginative efforts of Greek art all through its history, and one can hardly be too careful in keeping up the sense of this daintiness of execution through the entire course of its development. It is not only that the minute object of art, the tiny vase-painting, intaglio, coin, or cameo, often reduces into the palm of the hand lines grander than those of [223] many a life-sized or colossal figure; but there is also a sense in which it may be said that the Venus of Melos, for instance, is but a supremely well-executed object of vertu, in the most limited sense of the term. Those solemn images of the temple of Theseus are a perfect embodiment of the human ideal, of the reasonable soul and of a spiritual world; they are also the best made things of their kind, as an urn or a cup is well made. A perfect, many-sided development of tectonic crafts, a state such as the art of some nations has ended in, becomes for the Greeks a mere opportunity, a mere starting-ground for their imaginative presentment of man, moral and inspired. A world of material splendour, moulded clay, beaten gold, polished stone;--the informing, reasonable soul entering into that, reclaiming the metal and stone and clay, till they are as full of living breath as the real warm body itself; the presence of those two elements is continuous throughout the fortunes of Greek art after the heroic age, and the constant right estimate of their action and reaction, from period to period, its true philosophy.

BEGINNINGS OF GREEK SCULPTURE II: THE AGE OF GRAVEN IMAGES [224] CRITICS of Greek sculpture have often spoken of it as if it had been always work in colourless stone, against an almost colourless background. Its real background, as I have tried to show, was a world of exquisite craftsmanship, touching the minutest details of daily life with splendour and skill, in close correspondence with a peculiarly animated development of human existence--the energetic movement and stir of typically noble human forms, quite worthily clothed--amid scenery as poetic as Titian's. If shapes of colourless stone did come into that background, it was as the undraped human form comes into some of Titian's pictures, only to cool and solemnise its splendour; the work of the Greek sculptor being seldom in quite colourless stone, nor always or chiefly in fastidiously selected marble even, but often in richly toned metal (this or that sculptor preferring some special variety of the bronze he worked in, such as the [225] hepatizôn or liver-coloured bronze, or the bright golden alloy of Corinth), and in its consummate products chryselephantine,--work in gold and ivory, on a core of cedar. Pheidias, in the Olympian Zeus, in the Athene of the Parthenon, fulfils what that primitive, heroic goldsmiths' age, dimly discerned in Homer, already delighted in; and the celebrated work of which I have first to speak now, and with which Greek sculpture emerges from that half-mythical age and becomes in a certain sense historical, is a link in that goldsmiths' or chryselephantine tradition, carrying us forwards to the work of Pheidias, backwards to the elaborate Asiatic furniture of the chamber of Paris. When Pausanias visited Olympia, towards the end of the second century after Christ, he beheld, among other precious objects in the temple of Here, a splendidly wrought treasure-chest of cedar-wood, in which, according to a legend, quick as usual with the true human colouring, the mother of Cypselus had hidden him, when a child, from the enmity of her family, the Bacchiadae, then the nobility of Corinth. The child, named Cypselus after this incident (Cypsele being a Corinthian word for chest), became tyrant of Corinth, and his grateful descendants, as it was said, offered the beautiful old chest to the temple of Here, as a memorial of his preservation. That would have been not long after the year 625 B.C. So much for the [226] story which Pausanias heard--but inherent probability, and some points of detail in his description, tend to fix the origin of the chest at a date at least somewhat later; and as Herodotus, telling the story of the concealment of Cypselus, does not mention the dedication of the chest at Olympia at all, it may perhaps have been only one of many later imitations of antique art. But, whatever its date, Pausanias certainly saw the thing, and has left a long description of it, and we may trust his judgment at least as to its archaic style. We have here, then, something plainly visible at a comparatively recent date, something quite different from those perhaps wholly mythical objects described in Homer,--an object which seemed to so experienced an observer as Pausanias an actual work of earliest Greek art. Relatively to later Greek art, it may have seemed to him, what the ancient bronze doors with their Scripture histories, which we may still see in the south transept of the cathedral of Pisa, are to later Italian art. Pausanias tells us nothing as to its size, nor directly as to its shape. It may, for anything he says, have been oval, but it was probably rectangular, with a broad front and two narrow sides, standing, as the maker of it had designed, against the wall; for, in enumerating the various subjects wrought upon it, in five rows one above another, he seems to proceed, beginning at the bottom on the right-hand side, along the front [227] from right to left, and then back again, through the second row from left to right, and, alternating thus, upwards to the last subject, at the top, on the left-hand side. The subjects represented, most of which had their legends attached in difficult archaic writing, were taken freely, though probably with a leading idea, out of various poetic cycles, as treated in the works of those so-called cyclic poets, who continued the Homeric tradition. Pausanias speaks, as Homer does in his description of the shield of Achilles, of a kind and amount of expression in feature and gesture certainly beyond the compass of any early art, and we may believe we have in these touches only what the visitor heard from enthusiastic exegetae, the interpreters or sacristans; though any one who has seen the Bayeux tapestry, for instance, must recognise the pathos and energy of which, when really prompted by genius, even the earliest hand is capable. Some ingenious attempts have been made to restore the grouping of the scenes, with a certain formal expansion or balancing of subjects, their figures and dimensions, in true Assyrian manner, on the front and sides. We notice some fine emblematic figures, the germs of great artistic motives in after times, already playing their parts there,--Death, and Sleep, and Night. \"There was a woman supporting on her right arm a white child sleeping; and on the other arm she held a dark child, as if asleep; [228] and they lay with their feet crossed. And the inscription shows, what might be understood without it, that they are Death and Sleep, and Night, the nurse of both of them.\" But what is most noticeable is, as I have already said, that this work, like the chamber of Paris, like the Zeus of Pheidias, is chryselephantine, its main fabric cedar, and the figures upon it partly of ivory, partly of gold,* but (and this is the most peculiar characteristic of its style) partly wrought out of the wood of the chest itself. And, as we read the description, we can hardly help distributing in fancy gold and ivory, respectively, to their appropriate functions in the representation. The cup of Dionysus, and the wings of certain horses there, Pausanias himself tells us were golden. Were not the apples of the Hesperides, the necklace of Eriphyle, the bridles, the armour, the unsheathed sword in the hand of Amphiaraus, also of gold? Were not the other children, like the white image of Sleep, especially the naked child Alcmaeon, of ivory? with Alcestis and Helen, and that one of the Dioscuri whose beard was still ungrown? Were not ivory and gold, again, combined in the throne of Hercules, and in the three goddesses conducted before Paris? The \"chest of Cypselus\" fitly introduces the first historical period of Greek art, a period [229] coming down to about the year 560 B.C., and the government of Pisistratus at Athens; a period of tyrants like Cypselus and Pisistratus himself, men of strong, sometimes unscrupulous individuality, but often also acute and cultivated patrons of the arts. It begins with a series of inventions, one here and another there,--inventions still for the most part technical, but which are attached to single names; for, with the growth of art, the influence of individuals, gifted for the opening of new ways, more and more defines itself; and the school, open to all comers, from which in turn the disciples may pass to all parts of Greece, takes the place of the family, in which the knowledge of art descends as a tradition from father to son, or of the mere trade-guild. Of these early industries we know little but the stray notices of Pausanias, often ambiguous, always of doubtful credibility. What we do see, through these imperfect notices, is a real period of animated artistic activity, richly rewarded. Byzes of Naxos, for instance, is recorded as having first adopted the plan of sawing marble into thin plates for use on the roofs of temples instead of tiles; and that his name has come down to us at all, testifies to the impression this fair white surface made on its first spectators. Various islands of the Aegean become each the source of some new artistic device. It is a period still under the reign of Hephaestus, delighting, above all, in magnificent [230] metal-work. \"The Samians,\" says Herodotus, \"out of a tenth part of their profits--a sum of six talents--caused a mixing vessel of bronze to be made, after the Argolic fashion; around it are projections of griffins' heads; and they dedicated it in the temple of Here, placing beneath it three colossal figures of bronze, seven cubits in height, leaning upon their knees.\" That was in the thirty-seventh Olympiad, and may be regarded as characteristic of the age. For the popular imagination, a kind of glamour, some mysterious connexion of the thing with human fortunes, still attaches to the curious product of artistic hands, to the ring of Polycrates, for instance, with its early specimen of engraved smaragdus, as to the mythical necklace of Harmonia. Pheidon of Argos first makes coined money, and the obelisci--the old nail-shaped iron money, now disused- -are hung up in the temple of Here; for, even thus early, the temples are in the way of becoming museums. Names like those of Eucheir and Eugrammus, who were said to have taken the art of baking clay vases from Samos to Etruria, have still a legendary air, yet may be real surnames; as in the case of Smilis, whose name is derived from a graver's tool, and who made the ancient image of Here at Samos. Corinth--mater statuariae--becomes a great nursery of art at an early time. Some time before the twenty-ninth Olympiad, Butades of Sicyon, the potter, settled there. The record of [231] early inventions in Greece is sometimes fondly coloured with human sentiment or incident. It is on the butterfly wing of such an incident--the love-sick daughter of the artist, who outlines on the wall the profile of her lover as he sleeps in the lamplight, to keep by her in absence--that the name of Butades the potter has come down to us. The father fills up the outline, long preserved, it was believed, in the Nymphaeum at Corinth, and hence the art of modelling from the life in clay. He learns, further, a way of colouring his clay red, and fixes his masks along the temple eaves. The temple of Athene Chalcioecus--Athene of the brazen house--at Sparta, the work of Gitiades, celebrated about this time as architect, statuary, and poet; who made, besides the image in her shrine, and besides other Dorian songs, a hymn to the goddess--was so called from its crust or lining of bronze plates, setting forth, in richly embossed imagery, various subjects of ancient legend. What Pausanias, who saw it, describes, is like an elaborate development of that method of covering the interiors of stone buildings with metal plates, of which the \"Treasury\" at Mycenae is the earliest historical, and the house of Alcinous the heroic, type. In the pages of Pausanias, that glitter, \"as of the moon or the sun,\" which Ulysses stood still to wonder at, may still be felt. And on the right hand of this \"brazen house,\" he tells us, stood an [232] image of Zeus, also of bronze, the most ancient of all images of bronze. This had not been cast, nor wrought out of a single mass of metal, but, the various parts having been finished separately (probably beaten to shape with the hammer over a wooden mould), had been fitted together with nails or rivets. That was the earliest method of uniting the various parts of a work in metal--image, or vessel, or breastplate--a method allowing of much dainty handling of the cunning pins and rivets, and one which has its place still, in perfectly accomplished metal-work, as in the equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Coleoni, by Andrea Verrocchio, in the piazza of St. John and St. Paul at Venice. In the British Museum there is a very early specimen of it,--a large egg-shaped vessel, fitted together of several pieces, the projecting pins or rivets, forming a sort of diadem round the middle, being still sharp in form and heavily gilt. That method gave place in time to a defter means of joining the parts together, with more perfect unity and smoothness of surface, the art of soldering; and the invention of this art--of soldering iron, in the first instance--is coupled with the name of Glaucus of Chios, a name which, in connexion with this and other devices for facilitating the mechanical processes of art,--for perfecting artistic effect with economy of labour--became proverbial, the \"art of Glaucus\" being attributed to those who work well with rapidity and ease. [233] Far more fruitful still was the invention of casting, of casting hollow figures especially, attributed to Rhoecus and Theodorus, architects of the great temple at Samos. Such hollow figures, able, in consequence of their lightness, to rest, almost like an inflated bladder, on a single point--the entire bulk of a heroic rider, for instance, on the point of his horse's tail--admit of a much freer distribution of the whole weight or mass required, than is possible in any other mode of statuary; and the invention of the art of casting is really the discovery of liberty in composition.* And, at last, about the year 576 B.C., we come to the first true school of sculptors, the first clear example, as we seem to discern, of a communicable style, reflecting and interpreting some real individuality (the double personality, in this case, of two brothers) in the masters who evolved it, conveyed to disciples who came to acquire it from distant places, and taking root through them at various centres, where the names of the [234] masters became attached, of course,. to many fair works really by the hands of the pupils. Dipoenus and Scyllis, these first true masters, were born in Crete; but their work is connected mainly with Sicyon, at that time the chief seat of Greek art. \"In consequence of some injury done them,\" it is said, \"while employed there upon certain sacred images, they departed to another place, leaving their work unfinished; and, not long afterwards, a grievous famine fell upon Sicyon. Thereupon, the people of Sicyon, inquiring of the Pythian Apollo how they might be relieved, it was answered them, 'if Dipoenus and Scyllis should finish those images of the gods'; which thing the Sicyonians obtained from them, humbly, at a great price.\" That story too, as we shall see, illustrates the spirit of the age. For their sculpture they used the white marble of Paros, being workers in marble especially, though they worked also in ebony and in ivory, and made use of gilding. \"Figures of cedar-wood, partly incrusted with gold\"--kedrou zôdia chrysô diênthismena+--Pausanias says exquisitely, describing a certain work of their pupil, Dontas of Lacedaemon. It is to that that we have definitely come at last, in the school of Dipoenus and Scyllis. Dry and brief as these details may seem, they are the witness to an active, eager, animated period of inventions and beginnings, in which the Greek workman triumphs over the first [235] rough mechanical difficulties which beset him in the endeavour to record what his soul conceived of the form of priest or athlete then alive upon the earth, or of the ever-living gods, then already more seldom seen upon it. Our own fancy must fill up the story of the unrecorded patience of the workshop, into which we seem to peep through these scanty notices--the fatigue, the disappointments, the steps repeated, ending at last in that moment of success, which is all Pausanias records, somewhat uncertainly. And as this period begins with the chest of Cypselus, so it ends with a work in some respects similar, also seen and described by Pausanias--the throne, as he calls it, of the Amyclaean Apollo. It was the work of a well-known artist, Bathycles of Magnesia, who, probably about the year 550 B.C., with a company of workmen, came to the little ancient town of Amyclae, near Sparta, a place full of traditions of the heroic age. He had been invited thither to perform a peculiar task--the construction of a throne; not like the throne of the Olympian Zeus, and others numerous in after times, for a seated figure, but for the image of the local Apollo; no other than a rude and very ancient pillar of bronze, thirty cubits high, to which, Hermes-wise, head, arms, and feet were attached. The thing stood upright, as on a base, upon a kind of tomb or reliquary, in which, according to tradition, lay the remains of the young prince [236] Hyacinth, son of the founder of that place, beloved by Apollo for his beauty, and accidentally struck dead by him in play, with a quoit. From the drops of the lad's blood had sprung up the purple flower of his name, which bears on its petals the letters of the ejaculation of woe; and in his memory the famous games of Amyclae were celebrated, beginning about the time of the longest day, when the flowers are stricken by the sun and begin to fade--a festival marked, amid all its splendour, with some real melancholy, and serious thought of the dead. In the midst of the \"throne\" of Bathycles, this sacred receptacle, with the strange, half-humanised pillar above it, was to stand, probably in the open air, within a consecrated enclosure. Like the chest of Cypselus, the throne was decorated with reliefs of subjects taken from epic poetry, and it had supporting figures. Unfortunately, what Pausanias tells us of this monument hardly enables one to present it to the imagination with any completeness or certainty; its dimensions he himself was unable exactly to ascertain, and he does not tell us its material. There are reasons, however, for supposing that it was of metal; and amid these ambiguities, the decorations of its base, the grave or altar-tomb of Hyacinth, shine out clearly, and are also, for the most part, clear in their significance. \"There are wrought upon the altar figures, on the one side of Biris, on the other of [237] Amphitrite and Poseidon. Near Zeus and Hermes, in speech with each other, stand Dionysus and Semele, and, beside her, Ino. Demeter, Kore, and Pluto are also wrought upon it, the Fates and the Seasons above them, and with them Aphrodite, Athene, and Artemis. They are conducting Hyacinthus to heaven, with Polyboea, the sister of Hyacinthus, who died, as is told, while yet a virgin. . . . Hercules also is figured on the tomb; he too carried to heaven by Athene and the other gods. The daughters of Thestius also are upon the altar, and the Seasons again, and the Muses.\" It was as if many lines of solemn thought had been meant to unite, about the resting-place of this local Adonis, in imageries full of some dim promise of immortal life. But it was not so much in care for old idols as in the making of new ones that Greek art was at this time engaged. This whole first period of Greek art might, indeed, be called the period of graven images, and all its workmen sons of Daedalus; for Daedalus is the mythical, or all but mythical, representative of all those arts which are combined in the making of lovelier idols than had heretofore been seen. The old Greek word which is at the root of the name Daedalus,+ the name of a craft rather than a proper name, probably means to work curiously--all curiously beautiful wood-work is Daedal work; the main point about the curiously beautiful [238] chamber in which Nausicaa sleeps, in the Odyssey, being that, like some exquisite Swiss châlet, it is wrought in wood. But it came about that those workers in wood, whom Daedalus represents, the early craftsmen of Crete especially, were chiefly concerned with the making of religious images, like the carvers of Berchtesgaden and Oberammergau, the sort of daintily finished images of the objects of public or private devotion which such workmen would turn out. Wherever there was a wooden idol in any way fairer than others, finished, perhaps, sometimes, with colour and gilding, and appropriate real dress, there the hand of Daedalus had been. That such images were quite detached from pillar or wall, that they stood free, and were statues in the proper sense, showed that Greek art was already liberated from its earlier Eastern associations; such free-standing being apparently unknown in Assyrian art. And then, the effect of this Daedal skill in them was, that they came nearer to the proper form of humanity. It is the wonderful life-likeness of these early images which tradition celebrates in many anecdotes, showing a very early instinctive turn for, and delight in naturalism, in the Greek temper. As Cimabue, in his day, was able to charm men, almost as with illusion, by the simple device of half-closing the eyelids of his personages, and giving them, instead of round eyes, eyes that seemed to be in some degree sentient, and to feel [239] the light; so the marvellous progress in those Daedal wooden images was, that the eyes were open, so that they seemed to look,--the feet separated, so that they seemed to walk. Greek art is thus, almost from the first, essentially distinguished from the art of Egypt, by an energetic striving after truth in organic form. In representing the human figure, Egyptian art had held by mathematical or mechanical proportions exclusively. The Greek apprehends of it, as the main truth, that it is a living organism, with freedom of movement, and hence the infinite possibilities of motion, and of expression by motion, with which the imagination credits the higher sort of Greek sculpture; while the figures of Egyptian art, graceful as they often are, seem absolutely incapable of any motion or gesture, other than the one actually designed. The work of the Greek sculptor, together with its more real anatomy, becomes full also of human soul. That old, primitive, mystical, first period of Greek religion, with its profound, though half-conscious, intuitions of spiritual powers in the natural world, attaching itself not to the worship of visible human forms, but to relics, to natural or half-natural objects--the roughly hewn tree, the unwrought stone, the pillar, the holy cone of Aphrodite in her dimly-lighted cell at Paphos--had passed away. The second stage in the development of Greek religion had come; a [240] period in which poet and artist were busily engaged in the work of incorporating all that might be retained of the vague divinations of that earlier visionary time, in definite and intelligible human image and human story. The vague belief, the mysterious custom and tradition, develope themselves into an elaborately ordered ritual-- into personal gods, imaged in ivory and gold, sitting on beautiful thrones. Always, wherever a shrine or temple, great or small, is mentioned, there, we may conclude, was a visible idol, there was conceived to be the actual dwelling-place of a god. And this understanding became not less but more definite, as the temple became larger and more splendid, full of ceremony and servants, like the abode of an earthly king, and as the sacred presence itself assumed, little by little, the last beauties and refinements of the visible human form and expression. In what we have seen of this first period of Greek art, in all its curious essays and inventions, we may observe this demand for beautiful idols increasing in Greece--for sacred images, at first still rude, and in some degree the holier for their rudeness, but which yet constitute the beginnings of the religious style, consummate in the work of Pheidias, uniting the veritable image of man in the full possession of his reasonable soul, with the true religious mysticity, the signature there of something from afar. One by one these [241] new gods of bronze, or marble, or flesh-like ivory, take their thrones, at this or that famous shrine, like the images of this period which Pausanias saw in the temple of Here at Olympia--the throned Seasons, with Themis as the mother of the Seasons (divine rectitude being still blended, in men's fancies, with the unchanging physical order of things) and Fortune, and Victory \"having wings,\" and Kore and Demeter and Dionysus, already visibly there, around the image of Here herself, seated on a throne; and all chryselephantine, all in gold and ivory. Novel as these things are, they still undergo consecration at their first erecting. The figure of Athene, in her brazen temple at Sparta, the work of Gitiades, who makes also the image and the hymn, in triple service to the goddess; and again, that curious story of Dipoenus and Scyllis, brought back with so much awe to remove the public curse by completing their sacred task upon the images, show how simply religious the age still was--that this widespread artistic activity was a religious enthusiasm also; those early sculptors have still, for their contemporaries, a divine mission, with some kind of hieratic or sacred quality in their gift, distinctly felt. The development of the artist, in the proper sense, out of the mere craftsman, effected in the first division of this period, is now complete; and, in close connexion with that busy graving of religious images, which occupies its second [242] division, we come to something like real personalities, to men with individual characteristics--such men as Ageladas of Argos, Callon and Onatas of Aegina, and Canachus of Sicyon. Mere fragment as our information concerning these early masters is at the best, it is at least unmistakeably information about men with personal differences of temper and talent, of their motives, of what we call style. We have come to a sort of art which is no longer broadly characteristic of a general period, one whose products we might have looked at without its occurring to us to ask concerning the artist, his antecedents, and his school. We have to do now with types of art, fully impressed with the subjectivity, the intimacies of the artist. Among these freer and stronger personalities emerging thus about the beginning of the fifth century before Christ--about the period of the Persian war--the name to which most of this sort of personal quality attaches, and which is therefore very interesting, is the name of Canachus of Sicyon, who seems to have comprehended in himself all the various attainments in art which had been gradually developed in the schools of his native city--carver in wood, sculptor, brass-cutter, and toreutes; by toreuticê+ being meant the whole art of statuary in metals, and in their combination with other materials. At last we seem to see an actual person at work, and to some degree can follow, with natural curiosity, [243] the motions of his spirit and his hand. We seem to discern in all we know of his productions the results of individual apprehension--the results, as well as the limitations, of an individual talent. It is impossible to date exactly the chief period of the activity of Canachus. That the great image of Apollo, which he made for the Milesians, was carried away to Ecbatana by the Persian army, is stated by Pausanias; but there is a doubt whether this was under Xerxes, as Pausanias says, in the year 479 B.C., or twenty years earlier, under Darius. So important a work as this colossal image of Apollo, for so great a shrine as the Didymaeum, was probably the task of his maturity; and his career may, therefore, be regarded as having begun, at any rate, prior to the year 479 B.C., and the end of the Persian invasion the event which may be said to close this period of art. On the whole, the chief period of his activity is thought to have fallen earlier, and to have occupied the last forty years of the previous century; and he would thus have flourished, as we say, about fifty years before the manhood of Pheidias, as Mino of Fiesole fifty years before the manhood of Michelangelo. His chief works were an Aphrodite, wrought for the Sicyonians in ivory and gold; that Apollo of bronze carried away by the Persians, and restored to its place about the year B.C. 350; and a reproduction of the same work in cedar-wood [244], for the sanctuary of Apollo of the Ismenus, at Thebes. The primitive Greek worship, as we may trace it in Homer, presents already, on a minor scale, all the essential characteristics of the most elaborate Greek worship of after times-- the sacred enclosure, the incense and other offerings, the prayer of the priest, the shrine itself--a small one, roofed in by the priest with green boughs, not unlike a wayside chapel in modern times, and understood to be the dwelling-place of the divine person--within, almost certainly, an idol, with its own sacred apparel, a visible form, little more than symbolical perhaps, like the sacred pillar for which Bathycles made his throne at Amyclae, but, if an actual image, certainly a rude one. That primitive worship, traceable in almost all these particulars, even in the first book of the Iliad, had given place, before the time of Canachus at Sicyon, to a more elaborate ritual and a more completely designed image-work; and a little bronze statue, discovered on the site of Tenea, where Apollo was the chief object of worship,* the best representative of many similar marble figures-- those of Thera and Orchomenus, for instance--is supposed to represent Apollo as this still early age conceived him--youthful, naked, muscular, and with the germ of the Greek profile, but formally smiling, and with a formal diadem or fillet, over the long hair which [245] shows him to be no mortal athlete. The hands, like the feet, excellently modelled, are here extended downwards at the sides; but in some similar figures the hands are lifted, and held straight outwards, with the palms upturned. The Apollo of Canachus also had the hands thus raised, and on the open palm of the right hand was placed a stag, while with the left he grasped the bow. Pliny says that the stag was an automaton, with a mechanical device for setting it in motion, a detail which hints, at least, at the subtlety of workmanship with which those ancient critics, who had opportunity of knowing, credited this early artist. Of this work itself nothing remains, but we possess perhaps some imitations of it. It is probably this most sacred possession of the place which the coins of Miletus display from various points of view, though, of course, only on the smallest scale. But a little bronze figure in the British Museum, with the stag in the right hand, and in the closed left hand the hollow where the bow has passed, is thought to have been derived from it; and its points of style are still further illustrated by a marble head of similar character, also preserved in the British Museum, which has many marks of having been copied in marble from an original in bronze. A really ancient work, or only archaic, it certainly expresses, together with all that careful patience and hardness of workmanship which is characteristic of an early age, a certain Apolline [246] strength--a pride and dignity in the features, so steadily composed, below the stiff, archaic arrangement of the long, fillet-bound locks. It is the exact expression of that midway position, between an involved, archaic stiffness and the free play of individual talent, which is attributed to Canachus by the ancients. His Apollo of cedar-wood, which inhabited a temple near the gates of Thebes, on a rising ground, below which flowed the river Ismenus, had, according to Pausanias, so close a resemblance to that at Miletus that it required little skill in one who had seen either of them to tell what master had designed the other. Still, though of the same dimensions, while one was of cedar the other was of bronze-- a reproduction one of the other we may believe, but with the modifications, according to the use of good workmen even so early as Canachus, due to the difference of the material. For the likeness between the two statues, it is to be observed, is not the mechanical likeness of those earlier images represented by the statuette of Tenea, which spoke, not of the style of one master, but only of the manufacture of one workshop. In those two images of Canachus--the Milesian Apollo and the Apollo of the Ismenus--there were resemblances amid differences; resemblances, as we may understand, in what was nevertheless peculiar, novel, and even innovating in the precise conception of the god therein set forth; [247] resemblances which spoke directly of a single workman, though working freely, of one hand and one fancy, a likeness in that which could by no means be truly copied by another; it was the beginning of what we mean by the style of a master. Together with all the novelty, the innovating and improving skill, which has made Canachus remembered, an attractive, old-world, deeply-felt mysticity seems still to cling about what we read of these early works. That piety, that religiousness of temper, of which the people of Sicyon had given proof so oddly in their dealings with those old carvers, Scyllis and Dipoenus, still survives in the master who was chosen to embody his own novelty of idea and execution in so sacred a place as the shrine of Apollo at Miletus. Something still conventional, combined, in these images, with the effect of great artistic skill, with a palpable beauty and power, seems to have given them a really imposing religious character. Escaping from the rigid uniformities of the stricter archaic style, he is still obedient to certain hieratic influences and traditions; he is still reserved, self-controlled, composed or even mannered a little, as in some sacred presence, with the severity and strength of the early style. But there are certain notices which seem to show that he had his purely poetical motives also, as befitted his age; motives which prompted works of mere fancy, like his Muse [248] with the Lyre, symbolising the chromatic style of music; Aristocles his brother, and Ageladas of Argos executing each another statue to symbolise the two other orders of music. The Riding Boys, of which Pliny speaks, like the mechanical stag on the hand of Apollo, which he also describes, were perhaps mechanical toys, as Benvenuto Cellini made toys. In the Beardless Aesculapius, again--the image of the god of healing, not merely as the son of Apollo, but as one ever young--it is the poetry of sculpture that we see. This poetic feeling, and the piety of temper so deeply impressed upon his images of Apollo, seem to have been combined in his chryselephantine Aphrodite, as we see it very distinctly in Pausanias, enthroned with an apple in one hand and a poppy in the other, and with the sphere, or polos, about the head, in its quaint little temple or chapel at Sicyon, with the hierokêpis, or holy garden, about it. This is what Canachus has to give us instead of the strange, symbolical cone, with the lights burning around it, in its dark cell--the form under which Aphrodite was worshipped at her famous shrine of Paphos. \"A woman to keep it fair,\" Pausanias tells us, \"who may go in to no man, and a virgin called the water-bearer, who holds her priesthood for a year, are alone permitted to enter the sacred place. All others may gaze upon the [249] goddess and offer their prayers from the doorway. The seated image is the work of Canachus of Sicyon. It is wrought in ivory and gold, bearing a sphere on the head, and having in the one hand a poppy and in the other an apple. They offer to her the thighs of all victims excepting swine, burning them upon sticks of juniper, together with leaves of lad's-love, a herb found in the enclosure without, and nowhere else in the world. Its leaves are smaller than those of the beech and larger than the ilex; in form they are like an oak-leaf, and in colour resemble most the leaves of the poplar, one side dusky, the other white.\" That is a place one would certainly have liked to see. So real it seems!--the seated image, the people gazing through the doorway, the fragrant odour. Must it not still be in secret keeping somewhere?-- we are almost tempted to ask; maintained by some few solitary worshippers, surviving from age to age, among the villagers of Achaia. In spite of many obscurities, it may be said that what we know, and what we do not know, of Canachus illustrates the amount and sort of knowledge we possess about the artists of the period which he best represents. A naïveté--a freshness, an early-aged simplicity and sincerity--that, we may believe, had we their works before us, would be for us their chief aesthetic charm. Cicero remarked that, in contrast with [250] the works of the next generation of sculptors, there was a stiffness in the statues of Canachus which made them seem untrue to nature--\"Canachi signa rigidiora esse quam ut imitentur veritatem.\" But Cicero belongs to an age surfeited with artistic licence, and likely enough to undervalue the severity of the early masters, the great motive struggling still with the minute and rigid hand. So the critics of the last century ignored, or underrated, the works of the earlier Tuscan sculptors. In what Cicero calls \"rigidity\" of Canachus, combined with what we seem to see of his poetry of conception, his freshness, his solemnity, we may understand no really repellent hardness, but only that earnest patience of labour, the expression of which is constant in all the best work of an early time, in the David of Verrocchio, for instance, and in the early Flemish painters, as it is natural and becoming in youth itself. The very touch of the struggling hand was upon the work; but with the interest, the half-repressed animation of a great promise, fulfilled, as we now see, in the magnificent growth of Greek sculpture in the succeeding age; which, however, for those earlier workmen, meant the loins girt and the half-folded wings not yet quite at home in the air, with a gravity, a discretion and reserve, the charm of which, if felt in quiet, is hardly less than that of the wealth and fulness of final mastery.

THE MARBLES OF AEGINA [251] I HAVE dwelt the more emphatically upon the purely sensuous aspects of early Greek art, on the beauty and charm of its mere material and workmanship, the grace of hand in it, its chryselephantine character, because the direction of all the more general criticism since Lessing has been, somewhat one-sidedly, towards the ideal or abstract element in Greek art, towards what we may call its philosophical aspect. And, indeed, this philosophical element, a tendency to the realisation of a certain inward, abstract, intellectual ideal, is also at work in Greek art--a tendency which, if that chryselephantine influence is called Ionian, may rightly be called the Dorian, or, in reference to its broader scope, the European influence; and this European influence or tendency is really towards the impression of an order, a sanity, a proportion in all work, which shall reflect the inward order of human reason, now fully conscious of itself,--towards a sort of art in which the record and delineation of humanity, as active in the wide, inward world of [252] its passion and thought, has become more or less definitely the aim of all artistic handicraft. In undergoing the action of these two opposing influences, and by harmonising in itself their antagonism, Greek sculpture does but reflect the larger movements of more general Greek history. All through Greek history we may trace, in every sphere of the activity of the Greek mind, the action of these two opposing tendencies,--the centrifugal and centripetal tendencies, as we may perhaps not too fancifully call them. There is the centrifugal, the Ionian, the Asiatic tendency, flying from the centre, working with little forethought straight before it, in the development of every thought and fancy; throwing itself forth in endless play of undirected imagination; delighting in brightness and colour, in beautiful material, in changeful form everywhere, in poetry, in philosophy, even in architecture and its subordinate crafts. In the social and political order it rejoices in the freest action of local and personal influences; its restless versatility drives it towards the assertion of the principles of separatism, of individualism--the separation of state from state, the maintenance of local religions, the development of the individual in that which is most peculiar and individual in him. Its claim is in its grace, its freedom and happiness, its lively interest, the variety of its gifts to civilisation; its weakness is self-evident, and was what made the unity of Greece impossible. [253] It is this centrifugal tendency which Plato is desirous to cure, by maintaining, over against it, the Dorian influence of a severe simplification everywhere, in society, in culture, in the very physical nature of man. An enemy everywhere to variegation, to what is cunning or \"myriad-minded,\" he sets himself, in mythology, in music, in poetry, in every kind of art, to enforce the ideal of a sort of Parmenidean abstractness and calm. This exaggerated ideal of Plato's is, however, only the exaggeration of that salutary European tendency, which, finding human mind the most absolutely real and precious thing in the world, enforces everywhere the impress of its sanity, its profound reflexions upon things as they really are, its sense of proportion. It is the centripetal tendency, which links individuals to each other, states to states, one period of organic growth to another, under the reign of a composed, rational, self-conscious order, in the universal light of the understanding. Whether or not this temper, so clearly traceable as a distinct influence in the course of Greek development, was indeed the peculiar gift of the Dorian race, certainly that race is the best illustration of it, in its love of order, of that severe composition everywhere, of which the Dorian style of architecture is, as it were, a material symbol--in its constant aspiration after what is earnest and dignified, as exemplified most evidently in the religion of its predilection, the religion of Apollo. [254] For as that Ionian influence, the chryselephantine influence, had its patron in Hephaestus, belonged to the religion of Hephaestus, husband of Aphrodite, the representation of exquisite workmanship, of fine art in metal, coming from the East in close connexion with the artificial furtherance, through dress and personal ornament, of the beauty of the body; so that Dorian or European influence embodied itself in the religion of Apollo. For the development of this or that mythological conception, from its root in fact or law of the physical world, is very various in its course. Thus, Demeter, the spirit of life in grass,--and Dionysus, the \"spiritual form\" of life in the green sap,- -remain, to the end of men's thoughts and fancies about them, almost wholly physical. But Apollo, the \"spiritual form\" of sunbeams, early becomes (the merely physical element in his constitution being almost wholly suppressed) exclusively ethical,--the \"spiritual form\" of inward or intellectual light, in all its manifestations. He represents all those specially European ideas, of a reasonable, personal freedom, as understood in Greece; of a reasonable polity; of the sanity of soul and body, through the cure of disease and of the sense of sin; of the perfecting of both by reasonable exercise or ascêsis; his religion is a sort of embodied equity, its aim the realisation of fair reason and just consideration of the truth of things everywhere. [255] I cannot dwell on the general aspects of this subject further, but I would remark that in art also the religion of Apollo was a sanction of, and an encouragement towards the true valuation of humanity, in its sanity, its proportion, its knowledge of itself. Following after this, Greek art attained, in its reproductions of human form, not merely to the profound expression of the highest indwelling spirit of human intelligence, but to the expression also of the great human passions, of the powerful movements as well as of the calm and peaceful order of the soul, as finding in the affections of the body a language, the elements of which the artist might analyse, and then combine, order, and recompose. In relation to music, to art, to all those matters over which the Muses preside, Apollo, as distinct from Hermes, seems to be the representative and patron of what I may call reasonable music, of a great intelligence at work in art, of beauty attained through the conscious realisation of ideas. They were the cities of the Dorian affinity which early brought to perfection that most characteristic of Greek institutions, the sacred dance, with the whole gymnastic system which was its natural accompaniment. And it was the familiar spectacle of that living sculpture which developed, perhaps, beyond everything else in the Greek mind, at its best, a sense of the beauty and significance of the human form. Into that bewildered, dazzling world of minute [256] and dainty handicraft--the chamber of Paris, the house of Alcinous--in which the form of man alone had no adequate place, and as yet, properly, was not, this Dorian, European, Apolline influence introduced the intelligent and spiritual human presence, and gave it its true value, a value consistently maintained to the end of Greek art, by a steady hold upon and preoccupation with the inward harmony and system of human personality. In the works of the Asiatic tradition--the marbles of Nineveh, for instance--and, so far as we can see, in the early Greek art, which derives from it, as, for example, in the archaic remains from Cyprus, the form of man is inadequate, and below the measure of perfection attained there in the representation of the lower forms of life; just as in the little reflective art of Japan, so lovely in its reproduction of flower or bird, the human form alone comes almost as a caricature, or is at least untouched by any higher ideal. To that Asiatic tradition, then, with its perfect craftsmanship, its consummate skill in design, its power of hand, the Dorian, the European, the true Hellenic influence brought a revelation of the soul and body of man. And we come at last in the marbles of Aegina to a monument, which bears upon it the full expression of this humanism,--to a work, in which the presence of man, realised with complete mastery of hand, and with clear apprehension of how he actually is and moves and looks, [257] is touched with the freshest sense of that new-found, inward value; the energy of worthy passions purifying, the light of his reason shining through, bodily forms and motions, solemnised, attractive, pathetic. We have reached an extant work, real and visible, of an importance out of all proportion to anything actually remaining of earlier art, and justifying, by its direct interest and charm, our long prelude on the beginnings of Greek sculpture, while there was still almost nothing actually to see. These fifteen figures of Parian marble, of about two-thirds the size of life, forming, with some deficiencies, the east and west gables of a temple of Athene, the ruins of which still stand on a hill-side by the sea-shore, in a remote part of the island of Aegina, were discovered in the year 1811, and having been purchased by the Crown Prince, afterwards King Louis I., of Bavaria, are now the great ornament of the Glyptothek, or Museum of Sculpture, at Munich. The group in each gable consisted of eleven figures; and of the fifteen larger figures discovered, five belong to the eastern, ten to the western gable, so that the western gable is complete with the exception of one figure, which should stand in the place to which, as the groups are arranged at Munich, the beautiful figure, bending down towards the fallen leader, has been actually transferred from the eastern gable; certain fragments showing that the lost figure [258] corresponded essentially to this, which has therefore been removed hither from its place in the less complete group to which it properly belongs. For there are two legitimate views or motives in the restoration of ancient sculpture, the antiquarian and the aesthetic, as they may be termed respectively; the former limiting itself to the bare presentation of what actually remains of the ancient work, braving all shock to living eyes from the mutilated nose or chin; while the latter, the aesthetic method, requires that, with the least possible addition or interference, by the most skilful living hand procurable, the object shall be made to please, or at least content the living eye seeking enjoyment and not a bare fact of science, in the spectacle of ancient art. This latter way of restoration,--the aesthetic way,--followed by the famous connoisseurs of the Renaissance, has been followed here; and the visitor to Munich actually sees the marbles of Aegina, as restored after a model by the tasteful hand of Thorwaldsen. Different views have, however, been maintained as to the right grouping of the figures; but the composition of the two groups was apparently similar, not only in general character but in a certain degree of correspondence of all the figures, each to each. And in both the subject is a combat,--a combat between Greeks and Asiatics concerning the body of a Greek hero, fallen among the foemen,--an incident so characteristic [259] of the poetry of the heroic wars. In both cases, Athene, whose temple this sculpture was designed to decorate, intervenes, her image being complete in the western gable, the head and some other fragments remaining of that in the eastern. The incidents represented were probably chosen with reference to the traditions of Aegina in connexion with the Trojan war. Greek legend is ever deeply coloured by local interest and sentiment, and this monument probably celebrates Telamon, and Ajax his son, the heroes who established the fame of Aegina, and whom the united Greeks, on the morning of the battle of Salamis, in which the Aeginetans were distinguished above all other Greeks in bravery, invited as their peculiar, spiritual allies from that island. Accordingly, antiquarians are, for the most part, of opinion that the eastern gable represents the combat of Hercules (Hercules being the only figure among the warriors certainly to be identified), and of his comrade Telamon, against Laomedon of Troy, in which, properly, Hercules was leader, but here, as squire and archer, is made to give the first place to Telamon, as the titular hero of the place. Opinion is not so definite regarding the subject of the western gable, which, however, probably represents the combat between the Greeks and Trojans over the body of Patroclus. In both cases an Aeginetan hero, in the eastern gable Telamon, in the western [260] his son Ajax, is represented in the extreme crisis of battle, such a crisis as, according to the deep religiousness of the Greeks of that age, was a motive for the visible intervention of the goddess in favour of her chosen people. Opinion as to the date of the work, based mainly on the characteristics of the work itself, has varied within a period ranging from the middle of the sixtieth to the middle of the seventieth Olympiad, inclining on the whole to the later date, in the period of the Ionian revolt against Persia, and a few years earlier than the battle of Marathon. In this monument, then, we have a revelation in the sphere of art, of the temper which made the victories of Marathon and Salamis possible, of the true spirit of Greek chivalry as displayed in the Persian war, and in the highly ideal conception of its events, expressed in Herodotus and approving itself minutely to the minds of the Greeks, as a series of affairs in which the gods and heroes of old time personally intervened, and that not as mere shadows. It was natural that the high-pitched temper, the stress of thought and feeling, which ended in the final conflict of Greek liberty with Asiatic barbarism, should stimulate quite a new interest in the poetic legends of the earlier conflict between them in the heroic age. As the events of the Crusades and the chivalrous spirit of that period, leading men's minds back to ponder over the deeds of [261] Charlemagne and his paladins, gave birth to the composition of the Song of Roland, just so this Aeginetan sculpture displays the Greeks of a later age feeding their enthusiasm on the legend of a distant past, and is a link between Herodotus and Homer. In those ideal figures, pensive a little from the first, we may suppose, with the shadowiness of a past age, we may yet see how Greeks of the time of Themistocles really conceived of Homeric knight and squire. Some other fragments of art, also discovered in Aegina, and supposed to be contemporary with the temple of Athene, tend, by their roughness and immaturity, to show that this small building, so united in its effect, so complete in its simplicity, in the symmetry of its two main groups of sculpture, was the perfect artistic flower of its time and place. Yet within the limits of this simple unity, so important an element in the charm and impressiveness of the place, a certain inequality of design and execution may be detected; the hand of a slightly earlier master, probably, having worked in the western gable, while the master of the eastern gable has gone some steps farther than he in fineness and power of expression; the stooping figure of the supposed Ajax,--belonging to the western group in the present arrangement, but really borrowed, as I said, from the eastern,--which has in it something above the type of the figures grouped round it, being this later sculptor's work. Yet Overbeck, [262] who has elaborated the points of this distinction of styles, commends without reserve the technical excellence of the whole work, executed, as he says, \"with an application of all known instruments of sculpture; the delicate calculation of weight in the composition of the several parts, allowing the artist to dispense with all artificial supports, and to set his figures, with all their complex motions, and yet with plinths only three inches thick, into the basis of the gable; the bold use of the chisel, which wrought the shield, on the freely-held arm, down to a thickness of scarcely three inches; the fineness of the execution even in parts of the work invisible to an ordinary spectator, in the diligent finishing of which the only motive of the artist was to satisfy his own conviction as to the nature of good sculpture.\" It was the Dorian cities, Plato tells us, which first shook off the false Asiatic shame, and stripped off their clothing for purposes of exercise and training in the gymnasium; and it was part of the Dorian or European influence to assert the value in art of the unveiled and healthy human form. And here the artists of Aegina, notwithstanding Homer's description of Greek armour, glowing like the sun itself, have displayed the Greek warriors--Greek and Trojan alike--not in the equipments they would really have worn, but naked,--flesh fairer than that golden armour, though more subdued and tranquil [263] in effect on the spectator, the undraped form of man coming like an embodiment of the Hellenic spirit, and as an element of temperance, into the somewhat gaudy spectacle of Asiatic, or archaic art. Paris alone bears his dainty trappings, characteristically,--a coat of golden scale-work, the scales set on a lining of canvas or leather, shifting deftly over the delicate body beneath, and represented on the gable by the gilding, or perhaps by real gilt metal. It was characteristic also of that more truly Hellenic art--another element of its temperance--to adopt the use of marble in its works; and the material of these figures is the white marble of Paros. Traces of colour have, however, been found on certain parts of them. The outer surfaces of the shields and helmets have been blue; their inner parts and the crests of the helmets, red; the hem of the drapery of Athene, the edges of her sandals, the plinths on which the figures stand, also red; one quiver red, another blue; the eyes and lips, too, coloured; perhaps, the hair. There was just a limited and conventionalised use of colour, in effect, upon the marble. And although the actual material of these figures is marble, its coolness and massiveness suiting the growing severity of Greek thought, yet they have their reminiscences of work in bronze, in a certain slimness and tenuity, a certain dainty lightness of poise in their grouping, which [264] remains in the memory as a peculiar note of their style; the possibility of such easy and graceful balancing being one of the privileges or opportunities of statuary in cast metal, of that hollow casting in which the whole weight of the work is so much less than that of a work of equal size in marble, and which permits so much wider and freer a disposition of the parts about its centre of gravity. In Aegina the tradition of metal-work seems to have been strong, and Onatas, whose name is closely connected with Aegina, and who is contemporary with the presumably later portion of this monument, was above all a worker in bronze. Here again, in this lurking spirit of metal-work, we have a new element of complexity in the character of these precious remains. And then, to compass the whole work in our imagination, we must conceive yet another element in the conjoint effect; metal being actually mingled with the marble, brought thus to its daintiest point of refinement, as the little holes indicate, bored into the marble figures for the attachment of certain accessories in bronze,--lances, swords, bows, the Medusa's head on the aegis of Athene, and its fringe of little snakes. And as there was no adequate consciousness and recognition of the essentials of man's nature in the older, oriental art, so there is no pathos, no humanity in the more special sense, but a kind of hardness and cruelty rather, in those oft-repeated, long, matter-of-fact processions, on the [265] marbles of Nineveh, of slave-like soldiers on their way to battle mechanically, or of captives on their way to slavery or death, for the satisfaction of the Great King. These Greek marbles, on the contrary, with that figure yearning forward so graciously to the fallen leader, are deeply impressed with a natural pathetic effect--the true reflexion again of the temper of Homer in speaking of war. Ares, the god of war himself, we must remember, is, according to his original import, the god of storms, of winter raging among the forests of the Thracian mountains, a brother of the north wind. It is only afterwards that, surviving many minor gods of war, he becomes a leader of hosts, a sort of divine knight and patron of knighthood; and, through the old intricate connexion of love and war, and that amorousness which is the universally conceded privilege of the soldier's life, he comes to be very near Aphrodite,--the paramour of the goddess of physical beauty. So that the idea of a sort of soft dalliance mingles, in his character, so unlike that of the Christian leader, Saint George, with the idea of savage, warlike impulses; the fair, soft creature suddenly raging like a storm, to which, in its various wild incidents, war is constantly likened in Homer; the effects of delicate youth and of tempest blending, in Ares, into one expression, not without that cruelty which mingles also, like the influence of some malign fate upon him, with the finer [266] characteristics of Achilles, who is a kind of merely human double of Ares. And in Homer's impressions of war the same elements are blent,--the delicacy, the beauty of youth, especially, which makes it so fit for purposes of love, spoiled and wasted by the random flood and fire of a violent tempest; the glittering beauty of the Greek \"war-men,\" expressed in so many brilliant figures, and the splendour of their equipments, in collision with the miserable accidents of battle, and the grotesque indignities of death in it, brought home to our fancy by a hundred pathetic incidents,--the sword hot with slaughter, the stifling blood in the throat, the spoiling of the body in every member severally. He thinks of, and records, at his early ending, the distant home from which the boy came, who goes stumbling now, just stricken so wretchedly, his bowels in his hands. He pushes the expression of this contrast to the macabre even, suggesting the approach of those lower forms of life which await to- morrow the fair bodies of the heroes, who strive and fall to-day like these in the Aeginetan gables. For it is just that two-fold sentiment which this sculpture has embodied. The seemingly stronger hand which wrought the eastern gable has shown itself strongest in the rigid expression of the truth of pain, in the mouth of the famous recumbent figure on the extreme left, the lips just open at the corner, and in the hard-shut lips of Hercules. Otherwise, [267] these figures all smile faintly, almost like the monumental effigies of the Middle Age, with a smile which, even if it be but a result of the mere conventionality of an art still somewhat immature, has just the pathetic effect of Homer's conventional epithet \"tender,\" when he speaks of the flesh of his heroes. And together with this touching power there is also in this work the effect of an early simplicity, the charm of its limitations. For as art which has passed its prime has sometimes the charm of an absolute refinement in taste and workmanship, so immature art also, as we now see, has its own attractiveness in the naïveté, the freshness of spirit, which finds power and interest in simple motives of feeling, and in the freshness of hand, which has a sense of enjoyment in mechanical processes still performed unmechanically, in the spending of care and intelligence on every touch. As regards Italian art, the sculpture and paintings of the earlier Renaissance, the aesthetic value of this naïveté is now well understood; but it has its value in Greek sculpture also. There, too, is a succession of phases through which the artistic power and purpose grew to maturity, with the enduring charm of an unconventional, unsophisticated freshness, in that very early stage of it illustrated by these marbles of Aegina, not less than in the work of Verrocchio and Mino of Fiesole. Effects of this we may note in that sculpture [268] of Aegina, not merely in the simplicity, or monotony even, of the whole composition, and in the exact and formal correspondence of one gable to the other, but in the simple readiness with which the designer makes the two second spearmen kneel, against the probability of the thing, so as just to fill the space he has to compose in. The profiles are still not yet of the fully developed Greek type, but have a somewhat sharp prominence of nose and chin, as in Etrurian design, in the early sculpture of Cyprus, and in the earlier Greek vases; and the general proportions of the body in relation to the shoulders are still somewhat archaically slim. But then the workman is at work in dry earnestness, with a sort of hard strength in detail, a scrupulousness verging on stiffness, like that of an early Flemish painter; he communicates to us his still youthful sense of pleasure in the experience of the first rudimentary difficulties of his art overcome. And withal, these figures have in them a true expression of life, of animation. In this monument of Greek chivalry, pensive and visionary as it may seem, those old Greek knights live with a truth like that of Homer or Chaucer. In a sort of stiff grace, combined with a sense of things bright or sorrowful directly felt, the Aeginetan workman is as it were the Chaucer of Greek sculpture. THE AGE OF ATHLETIC PRIZEMEN: A CHAPTER IN GREEK ART [269] IT is pleasant when, looking at medieval sculpture, we are reminded of that of Greece; pleasant likewise, conversely, in the study of Greek work to be put on thoughts of the Middle Age. To the refined intelligence, it would seem, there is something attractive in complex expression as such. The Marbles of Aegina, then, may remind us of the Middle Age where it passes into the early Renaissance, of its most tenderly finished warrior-tombs at Westminster or in Florence. A less mature phase of medieval art is recalled to our fancy by a primitive Greek work in the Museum of Athens, Hermes, bearing a ram, a little one, upon his shoulders. He bears it thus, had borne it round the walls of Tanagra, as its citizens told, by way of purifying that place from the plague, and brings to mind, of course, later images of the \"Good Shepherd.\" It is not the subject of the work, however, but its style, that sets us down in thought before some gothic [270] cathedral front. Suppose the Hermes Kriophorus lifted into one of those empty niches, and the archaeologist will inform you rightly, as at Auxerre or Wells, of Italian influence, perhaps of Italian workmen, and along with them indirect old Greek influence coming northwards; while the connoisseur assures us that all good art, at its respective stages of development, is in essential qualities everywhere alike. It is observed, as a note of imperfect skill, that in that carved block of stone the animal is insufficiently detached from the shoulders of its bearer. Again, how precisely gothic is the effect! Its very limitation as sculpture emphasises the function of the thing as an architectural ornament. And the student of the Middle Age, if it came within his range, would be right in so esteeming it. Hieratic, stiff and formal, if you will, there is a knowledge of the human body in it nevertheless, of the body, and of the purely animal soul therein, full of the promise of what is coming in that chapter of Greek art which may properly be entitled, \"The Age of Athletic Prizemen.\" That rude image, a work perhaps of Calamis of shadowy fame, belongs to a phase of art still in grave-clothes or swaddling-bands, still strictly subordinate to religious or other purposes not immediately its own. It had scarcely to wait for the next generation to be superseded, and we need not wonder that but little of it remains. But that it was a widely active phase of art, with [271] all the vigour of local varieties, is attested by another famous archaic monument, too full of a kind of sacred poetry to be passed by. The reader does not need to be reminded that the Greeks, vivid as was their consciousness of this life, cared much always for the graves of the dead; that to be cared for, to be honoured, in one's grave, to have tymbos amphipolos,+ a frequented tomb, as Pindar says, was a considerable motive with them, even among the young. In the study of its funeral monuments we might indeed follow closely enough the general development of art in Greece from beginning to end. The carved slab of the ancient shepherd of Orchomenus, with his dog and rustic staff, the stélé of the ancient man-at-arms signed \"Aristocles,\" rich originally with colour and gold and fittings of bronze, are among the few still visible pictures, or portraits, it may be, of the earliest Greek life. Compare them, compare their expression, for a moment, with the deeply incised tombstones of the Brethren of St. Francis and their clients, which still roughen the pavement of Santa Croce at Florence, and recall the varnished polychrome decoration of those Greek monuments in connexion with the worn-out blazonry of the funeral brasses of England and Flanders. The Shepherd, the Hoplite, begin a series continuous to the era of full Attic mastery in its gentlest mood, with a large and varied store of memorials of the dead, which, not so strangely as it may [272] seem at first sight, are like selected pages from daily domestic life. See, for instance, at the British Museum, Trypho,-- \"the son of Eutychus,\" one of the very pleasantest human likenesses there, though it came from a cemetery--a son it was hard to leave in it at nineteen or twenty. With all the suppleness, the delicate muscularity, of the flower of his youth, his handsome face sweetened by a kind and simple heart, in motion, surely, he steps forth from some shadowy chamber, strigil in hand, as of old, and with his coarse towel or cloak of monumental drapery over one shoulder. But whither precisely, you may ask, and as what, is he moving there in the doorway? Well! in effect, certainly, it is the memory of the dead lad, emerging thus from his tomb,--the still active soul, or permanent thought, of him, as he most liked to be. The Harpy Tomb, so called from its mysterious winged creatures with human faces, carrying the little shrouded souls of the dead, is a work many generations earlier than that graceful monument of Trypho. It was from an ancient cemetery at Xanthus in Lycia that it came to the British Museum. The Lycians were not a Greek people; but, as happened even with \"barbarians\" dwelling on the coast of Asia Minor, they became lovers of the Hellenic culture, and Xanthus, their capital, as may be judged from the beauty of its ruins, managed to have a considerable portion in Greek art, though infusing it [273] with a certain Asiatic colour. The frugally designed frieze of the Harpy Tomb, in the lowest possible relief, might fairly be placed between the monuments of Assyria and those primitive Greek works among which it now actually stands. The stiffly ranged figures in any other than strictly archaic work would seem affected. But what an undercurrent of refined sentiment, presumably not Asiatic, not \"barbaric,\" lifting those who felt thus about death so early into the main stream of Greek humanity, and to a level of visible refinement in execution duly expressive of it! In that old burial-place of Xanthus, then, a now nameless family, or a single bereaved member of it, represented there as a diminutive figure crouching on the earth in sorrow, erected this monument, so full of family sentiment, and of so much value as illustrating what is for us a somewhat empty period in the history of Greek art, strictly so called. Like the less conspicuously adorned tombs around it, like the tombs in Homer, it had the form of a tower--a square tower about twenty-four feet high, hollowed at the top into a small chamber, for the reception, through a little doorway, of the urned ashes of the dead. Four sculptured slabs were placed at this level on the four sides of the tower in the manner of a frieze. I said that the winged creatures with human faces carry the little souls of the dead. The interpretation of these mystic [274] imageries is, in truth, debated. But in face of them, and remembering how the sculptors and glass-painters of the Middle Age constantly represented the souls of the dead as tiny bodies, one can hardly doubt as to the meaning of these particular details which, repeated on every side, seem to give the key-note of the whole composition.* Those infernal, or celestial, birds, indeed, are not true to what is understood to be the harpy form. Call them sirens, rather. People, and not only old people, as you know, appear sometimes to have been quite charmed away by what dismays most of us. The tiny shrouded figures which the sirens carry are carried very tenderly, and seem to yearn in their turn towards those kindly nurses as they pass on their way to a new world. Their small stature, as I said, does not prove them infants, but only new-born into that other life, and contrasts their helplessness with the powers, the great presences, now around them. A cow, far enough from Myron's famous illusive animal, suckles her calf. She is [275] one of almost any number of artistic symbols of new-birth, of the renewal of life, drawn from a world which is, after all, so full of it. On one side sits enthroned, as some have thought, the Goddess of Death; on the opposite side the Goddess of Life, with her flowers and fruit. Towards her three young maidens are advancing--were they still alive thus, graceful, virginal, with their long, plaited hair, and long, delicately-folded tunics, looking forward to carry on their race into the future? Presented severally, on the other sides of the dark hollow within, three male persons--a young man, an old man, and a boy--seem to be bringing home, somewhat wearily, to their \"long home,\" the young man, his armour, the boy, and the old man, like old Socrates, the mortuary cock, as they approach some shadowy, ancient deity of the tomb, or it may be the throned impersonation of their \"fathers of old.\" The marble surface was coloured, at least in part, with fixtures of metal here and there. The designer, whoever he may have been, was possessed certainly of some tranquillising second thoughts concerning death, which may well have had their value for mourners; and he has expressed those thoughts, if lispingly, yet with no faults of commission, with a befitting grace, and, in truth, at some points, with something already of a really Hellenic definition and vigour. He really speaks to us in his work, through his symbolic and [276] imitative figures,--speaks to our intelligence persuasively. The surviving thought of the lad Trypho, returning from his tomb to the living, was of athletic character; how he was and looked when in the flower of his strength. And it is not of the dead but of the living, who look and are as he, that the artistic genius of this period is full. It is a period, truly, not of battles, such as those commemorated in the Marbles of Aegina, but of more peaceful contests- -at Olympia, at the Isthmus, at Delphi--the glories of which Pindar sang in language suggestive of a sort of metallic beauty, firmly cut and embossed, like crowns of wild olive, of parsley and bay, in crisp gold. First, however, it had been necessary that Greece should win its liberty, political standing-ground, and a really social air to breathe in, with development of the youthful limbs. Of this process Athens was the chief scene; and the earliest notable presentment of humanity by Athenian art was in celebration of those who had vindicated liberty with their lives--two youths again, in a real incident, which had, however, the quality of a poetic invention, turning, as it did, on that ideal or romantic friendship which was characteristic of the Greeks. With something, perhaps, of hieratic convention, yet presented as they really were, as friends and admirers loved to think of them, [277] Harmodius and Aristogeiton stood, then, soon after their heroic death, side by side in bronze, the work of Antenor, in a way not to be forgotten, when, thirty years afterwards, a foreign tyrant, Xerxes, carried them away to Persia. Kritios and Nesistes were, therefore, employed for a reproduction of them, which would naturally be somewhat more advanced in style. In its turn this also disappeared. The more curious student, however, would still fancy he saw the trace of it--of that copy, or of the original, afterwards restored to Athens--here or there, on vase or coin. But in fact the very images of the heroic youths were become but ghosts, haunting the story of Greek art, till they found or seemed to find a body once more when, not many years since, an acute observer detected, as he thought, in a remarkable pair of statues in the Museum of Naples, if freed from incorrect restorations and rightly set together, a veritable descendant from the original work of Antenor. With all their truth to physical form and movement, with a conscious mastery of delineation, they were, nevertheless, in certain details, in the hair, for instance, archaic, or rather archaistic--designedly archaic, as from the hand of a workman, for whom, in this subject, archaism, the very touch of the ancient master, had a sentimental or even a religious value. And unmistakeably they were young assassins, moving, with more than fraternal unity, the younger in advance of and covering [278] the elder, according to the account given by Herodotus, straight to their purpose;--against two wicked brothers, as you remember, two good friends, on behalf of the dishonoured sister of one of them. Archaeologists have loved to adjust them tentatively, with various hypotheses as to the precise manner in which they thus went together. Meantime they have figured plausibly as representative of Attic sculpture at the end of its first period, still immature indeed, but with a just claim to take breath, so to speak, having now accomplished some stades of the journey. Those young heroes of Athenian democracy, then, indicate already what place Athens and Attica will occupy in the supreme age of art soon to come; indicate also the subject from which that age will draw the main stream of its inspiration--living youth, \"iconic\" in its exact portraiture, or \"heroic\" as idealised in various degrees under the influence of great thoughts about it--youth in its self-denying contention towards great effects; great intrinsically, as at Marathon, or when Harmodius and Aristogeiton fell, or magnified by the force and splendour of Greek imagination with the stimulus of the national games. For the most part, indeed, it is not with youth taxed spasmodically, like that of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, and the \"necessity\" that was upon it, that the Athenian mind and heart are now busied; but with youth [279] in its voluntary labours, its habitual and measured discipline, labour for its own sake, or in wholly friendly contest for prizes which in reality borrow all their value from the quality of the receiver. We are with Pindar, you see, in this athletic age of Greek sculpture. It is the period no longer of battle against a foreign foe, recalling the Homeric ideal, nor against the tyrant at home, fixing a dubious ideal for the future, but of peaceful combat as a fine art--pulvis Olympicus. Anticipating the arts, poetry, a generation before Myron and Polycleitus, had drawn already from the youthful combatants in the great national games the motives of those Odes, the bracing words of which, as I said, are like work in fine bronze, or, as Pindar himself suggests, in ivory and gold. Sung in the victor's supper- room, or at the door of his abode, or with the lyre and the pipe as they took him home in procession through the streets, or commemorated the happy day, or in a temple where he laid up his crown, Pindar's songs bear witness to the pride of family or township in the physical perfection of son or citizen, and his consequent success in the long or the short foot-race, or the foot-race in armour, or the pentathlon, or any part of it. \"Now on one, now on another,\" as the poet tells, \"doth the grace that quickeneth (quickeneth, literally, on the race-course) look favourably.\" Ariston hydôr+ he declares indeed, and the actual prize, as we know, was in itself of little or no worth--a [280] cloak, in the Athenian games, but at the greater games a mere handful of parsley, a few sprigs of pine or wild olive. The prize has, so to say, only an intellectual or moral value. Yet actually Pindar's own verse is all of gold and wine and flowers, is itself avowedly a flower, or \"liquid nectar,\" or \"the sweet fruit of his soul to men that are winners in the games.\" \"As when from a wealthy hand one lifting a cup, made glad within with the dew of the vine, maketh gift thereof to a youth\":--the keynote of Pindar's verse is there! This brilliant living youth of his day, of the actual time, for whom, as he says, he \"awakes the clear-toned gale of song\"- -epeôn hoimon ligyn+--that song mingles sometimes with the splendours of a recorded ancient lineage, or with the legendary greatness of a remoter past, its gods and heroes, patrons or ancestors, it might be, of the famous young man of the hour, or with the glory and solemnity of the immortals themselves taking a share in mortal contests. On such pretext he will tell a new story, or bring to its last perfection by his manner of telling it, his pregnancy and studied beauty of expression, an old one. The tale of Castor and Polydeukes, the appropriate patrons of virginal yet virile youth, starred and mounted, he tells in all its human interest. \"Ample is the glory stored up for Olympian winners.\" And what Pindar's contemporaries asked of him for the due appreciation, the [281] consciousness, of it, by way of song, that the next generation sought, by way of sculptural memorial in marble, and above all, as it seems, in bronze. The keen demand for athletic statuary, the honour attached to the artist employed to make his statue at Olympia, or at home, bear witness again to the pride with which a Greek town, the pathos, it might be, with which a family, looked back to the victory of one of its members. In the courts of Olympia a whole population in marble and bronze gathered quickly,--a world of portraits, out of which, as the purged and perfected essence, the ideal soul, of them, emerged the Diadumenus, for instance, the Discobolus, the so-called Jason of the Louvre. Olympia was in truth, as Pindar says again, a mother of gold-crowned contests, the mother of a large offspring. All over Greece the enthusiasm for gymnastic, for the life of the gymnasia, prevailed. It was a gymnastic which, under the happy conditions of that time, was already surely what Plato pleads for, already one half music, mousikê,+ a matter, partly, of character and of the soul, of the fair proportion between soul and body, of the soul with itself. Who can doubt it who sees and considers the still irresistible grace, the contagious pleasantness, of the Discobolus, the Diadumenus, and a few other precious survivals from the athletic age which immediately preceded the manhood of Pheidias, between the Persian and the Peloponnesian wars? [282] Now, this predominance of youth, of the youthful form, in art, of bodily gymnastic promoting natural advantages to the utmost, of the physical perfection developed thereby, is a sign that essential mastery has been achieved by the artist--the power, that is to say, of a full and free realisation. For such youth, in its very essence, is a matter properly within the limits of the visible, the empirical, world; and in the presentment of it there will be no place for symbolic hint, none of that reliance on the helpful imagination of the spectator, the legitimate scope of which is a large one, when art is dealing with religious objects, with what in the fulness of its own nature is not really expressible at all. In any passable representation of the Greek discobolus, as in any passable representation of an English cricketer, there can be no successful evasion of the natural difficulties of the thing to be done--the difficulties of competing with nature itself, or its maker, in that marvellous combination of motion and rest, of inward mechanism with the so smoothly finished surface and outline--finished ad unguem-- which enfold it. Of the gradual development of such mastery of natural detail, a veritable counterfeit of nature, the veritable rhythmus of the runner, for example--twinkling heel and ivory shoulder--we have hints and traces in the historians of art. One had attained the very turn and texture of the [283] crisp locks, another the very feel of the tense nerve and full-flushed vein, while with another you saw the bosom of Ladas expand, the lips part, as if for a last breath ere he reached the goal. It was like a child finding little by little the use of its limbs, the testimony of its senses, at a definite moment. With all its poetic impulse, it is an age clearly of faithful observation, of what we call realism, alike in its iconic and heroic work; alike in portraiture, that is to say, and in the presentment of divine or abstract types. Its workmen are close students now of the living form as such; aim with success at an ever larger and more various expression of its details; or replace a conventional statement of them by a real and lively one. That it was thus is attested indirectly by the fact that they busied themselves, seemingly by way of a tour de force, and with no essential interest in such subject, alien as it was from the pride of health which is characteristic of the gymnastic life, with the expression of physical pain, in Philoctetes, for instance. The adroit, the swift, the strong, in full and free exercise of their gifts, to the delight of others and of themselves, though their sculptural record has for the most part perished, are specified in ancient literary notices as the sculptor's favourite subjects, repeated, remodelled, over and over again, for the adornment of the actual scene of athletic success, or the market-place at home of the distant Northern or Sicilian town [284] whence the prizeman had come.--A countless series of popular illustrations to Pindar's Odes! And if art was still to minister to the religious sense, it could only be by clothing celestial spirits also as nearly as possible in the bodily semblance of the various athletic combatants, whose patrons respectively they were supposed to be. The age to which we are come in the story of Greek art presents to us indeed only a chapter of scattered fragments, of names that are little more, with but surmise of their original significance, and mere reasonings as to the sort of art that may have occupied what are really empty spaces. Two names, however, connect themselves gloriously with certain extant works of art; copies, it is true, at various removes, yet copies of what is still found delightful through them, and by copyists who for the most part were themselves masters. Through the variations of the copyist, the restorer, the mere imitator, these works are reducible to two famous original types--the Discobolus or quoit-player, of Myron, the beau idéal (we may use that term for once justly) of athletic motion; and the Diadumenus of Polycleitus, as, binding the fillet or crown of victory upon his head, he presents the beau idéal of athletic repose, and almost begins to think. Myron was a native of Eleutherae, and a pupil of Ageladas of Argos. There is nothing more to tell by way of positive detail of this so famous [285] artist, save that the main scene of his activity was Athens, now become the centre of the artistic as of all other modes of life in Greece. Multiplicasse veritatem videtur, says Pliny. He was in fact an earnest realist or naturalist, and rose to central perfection in the portraiture, the idealised portraiture, of athletic youth, from a mastery first of all in the delineation of inferior objects, of little lifeless or living things. Think, however, for a moment, how winning such objects are still, as presented on Greek coins;--the ear of corn, for instance, on those of Metapontum; the microscopic cockle-shell, the dolphins, on the coins of Syracuse. Myron, then, passes from pleasant truth of that kind to the delineation of the worthier sorts of animal life,--the ox, the dog-- to nothing short of illusion in the treatment of them, as ancient connoisseurs would have you understand. It is said that there are thirty-six extant epigrams on his brazen cow. That animal has her gentle place in Greek art, from the Siren tomb, suckling her young there, as the type of eternal rejuvenescence, onwards to the procession of the Elgin frieze, where, still breathing deliciously of the distant pastures, she is led to the altar. We feel sorry for her, as we look, so lifelike is the carved marble. The sculptor who worked there, whoever he may have been, had profited doubtless by the study of Myron's famous work. For what purpose he made it, does not appear;--as [286] an architectural ornament; or a votive offering; perhaps only because he liked making it. In hyperbolic epigram, at any rate, the animal breathes, explaining sufficiently the point of Pliny's phrase regarding Myron--Corporum curiosus. And when he came to his main business with the quoit-player, the wrestler, the runner, he did not for a moment forget that they too were animals, young animals, delighting in natural motion, in free course through the yielding air, over uninterrupted space, according to Aristotle's definition of pleasure: \"the unhindered exercise of one's natural force.\" Corporum tenus curiosus:--he was a \"curious workman\" as far as the living body is concerned. Pliny goes on to qualify that phrase by saying that he did not express the sensations of the mind-- animi sensus. But just there, in fact, precisely in such limitation, we find what authenticates Myron's peculiar value in the evolution of Greek art. It is of the essence of the athletic prizeman, involved in the very ideal of the quoit-player, the cricketer, not to give expression to mind, in any antagonism to, or invasion of, the body; to mind as anything more than a function of the body, whose healthful balance of functions it may so easily perturb;--to disavow that insidious enemy of the fairness of the bodily soul as such. Yet if the art of Myron was but little occupied with the reasonable soul (animus), with those mental situations the expression of which, though [287] it may have a pathos and a beauty of its own, is for the most part adverse to the proper expression of youth, to the beauty of youth, by causing it to be no longer youthful, he was certainly a master of the animal or physical soul there (anima); how it is, how it displays itself, as illustrated, for instance, in the Discobolus. Of voluntary animal motion the very soul is undoubtedly there. We have but translations into marble of the original in bronze. In that, it was as if a blast of cool wind had congealed the metal, or the living youth, fixed him imperishably in that moment of rest which lies between two opposed motions, the backward swing of the right arm, the movement forwards on which the left foot is in the very act of starting. The matter of the thing, the stately bronze or marble, thus rests indeed; but the artistic form of it, in truth, scarcely more, even to the eye, than the rolling ball or disk, may be said to rest, at every moment of its course,--just metaphysically, you know. This mystery of combined motion and rest, of rest in motion, had involved, of course, on the part of the sculptor who had mastered its secret, long and intricate consideration. Archaic as it is, primitive still in some respects, full of the primitive youth it celebrates, it is, in fact, a learned work, and suggested to a great analyst of literary style, singular as it may seem, the \"elaborate\" or \"contorted\" manner in literature [288] of the later Latin writers, which, however, he finds \"laudable\" for its purpose. Yet with all its learned involution, thus so oddly characterised by Quintilian, so entirely is this quality subordinated to the proper purpose of the Discobolus as a work of art, a thing to be looked at rather than to think about, that it makes one exclaim still, with the poet of athletes,--The natural is ever best!\"--to de phya hapan kratiston.+ Perhaps that triumphant, unimpeachable naturalness is after all the reason why, on seeing it for the first time, it suggests no new view of the beauty of human form, or point of view for the regarding of it; is acceptable rather as embodying (say, in one perfect flower) all one has ever fancied or seen, in old Greece or on Thames' side, of the unspoiled body of youth, thus delighting itself and others, at that perfect, because unconscious, point of good-fortune, as it moves or rests just there for a moment, between the animal and spiritual worlds. \"Grant them,\" you pray in Pindar's own words, grant them with feet so light to pass through life!\" The face of the young man, as you see him in the British Museum for instance, with fittingly inexpressive expression, (look into, look at the curves of, the blossom-like cavity of the opened mouth) is beautiful, but not altogether virile. The eyes, the facial lines which they gather into one, seem ready to follow the coming motion of the discus as those of an onlooker might be; [289] but that head does not really belong to the discobolus. To be assured of this you have but to compare with that version in the British Museum the most authentic of all derivations from the original, preserved till lately at the Palazzo Massimi in Rome. Here, the vigorous head also, with the face, smooth enough, but spare, and tightly drawn over muscle and bone, is sympathetic with, yields itself to, the concentration, in the most literal sense, of all beside;--is itself, in very truth, the steady centre of the discus, which begins to spin; as the source of will, the source of the motion with which the discus is already on the wing,--that, and the entire form. The Discobolus of the Massimi Palace presents, moreover, in the hair, for instance, those survivals of primitive manner which would mark legitimately Myron's actual pre- Pheidiac standpoint; as they are congruous also with a certain archaic, a more than merely athletic, spareness of form generally-- delightful touches of unreality in this realist of a great time, and of a sort of conventionalism that has an attraction in itself. Was it a portrait? That one can so much as ask the question is a proof how far the master, in spite of his lingering archaism, is come already from the antique marbles of Aegina. Was it the portrait of one much-admired youth, or rather the type, the rectified essence, of many such, at the most pregnant, the essential, moment, of the [290] exercise of their natural powers, of what they really were? Have we here, in short, the sculptor Myron's reasoned memory of many a quoit- player, of a long flight of quoit-players; as, were he here, he might have given us the cricketer, the passing generation of cricketers, sub specie eternitatis, under the eternal form of art? Was it in that case a commemorative or votive statue, such as Pausanias found scattered throughout Greece? Was it, again, designed to be part only of some larger decorative scheme, as some have supposed of the Venus of Melos, or a work of genre as we say, a thing intended merely to interest, to gratify the taste, with no further purpose? In either case it may have represented some legendary quoit-player--Perseus at play with Acrisius fatally, as one has suggested; or Apollo with Hyacinthus, as Ovid describes him in a work of poetic genre. And if the Discobolus is, after all, a work of genre--a work merely imitative of the detail of actual life--for the adornment of a room in a private house, it would be only one of many such produced in Myron's day. It would be, in fact, one of the pristae directly attributed to him by Pliny, little congruous as they may seem with the grandiose motions of his more characteristic work. The pristae, the sawyers,--a celebrated creation of the kind,--is supposed to have given its name to the whole class of like things. No [291] age, indeed, since the rudiments of art were mastered, can have been without such reproductions of the pedestrian incidents of every day, for the mere pleasant exercise at once of the curiosity of the spectator and the imitative instinct of the producer. The Terra- Cotta Rooms of the Louvre and the British Museum are a proof of it. One such work indeed there is, delightful in itself, technically exquisite, most interesting by its history, which properly finds its place beside the larger, the full-grown, physical perfection of the Discobolus, one of whose alert younger brethren he may be,--the Spinario namely, the boy drawing a thorn from his foot, preserved in the so rare, veritable antique bronze at Rome, in the Museum of the Capitol, and well known in a host of ancient and modern reproductions. There, or elsewhere in Rome, tolerated in the general destruction of ancient sculpture--like the \"Wolf of the Capitol,\" allowed by way of heraldic sign, as in modern Siena, or like the equestrian figure of Marcus Aurelius doing duty as Charlemagne,--like those, but like very few other works of the kind, the Spinario remained, well-known and in honour, throughout the Middle Age. Stories like that of Ladas the famous runner, who died as he reached the goal in a glorious foot- race of boys, the subject of a famous work by Myron himself, (the \"last breath,\" as you saw, was on the boy's lips) were told of the half-grown bronze lad at the Capitol. [292] Of necessity, but fatally, he must pause for a few moments in his course; or the course is at length over, or the breathless journey with some all-important tidings; and now, not till now, he thinks of resting to draw from the sole of his foot the cruel thorn, driven into it as he ran. In any case, there he still sits for a moment, for ever, amid the smiling admiration of centuries, in the agility, in the perfect naïveté also as thus occupied, of his sixteenth year, to which the somewhat lengthy or attenuated structure of the limbs is conformable. And then, in this attenuation, in the almost Egyptian proportions, in the shallowness of the chest and shoulders especially, in the Phoenician or old Greek sharpness and length of profile, and the long, conventional, wire-drawn hair of the boy, arching formally over the forehead and round the neck, there is something of archaism, of that archaism which survives, truly, in Myron's own work, blending with the grace and power of well-nigh the maturity of Greek art. The blending of interests, of artistic alliances, is certainly delightful. Polycleitus, the other famous name of this period, and with a fame justified by work we may still study, at least in its immediate derivatives, had also tried his hand with success in such subjects. In the Astragalizontes, for instance, well known to antiquity in countless reproductions, he had treated an incident of the every-day life of every age, which Plato sketches by the way. [293] Myron, by patience of genius, had mastered the secret of the expression of movement, had plucked out the very heart of its mystery. Polycleitus, on the other hand, is above all the master of rest, of the expression of rest after toil, in the victorious and crowned athlete, Diadumenus. In many slightly varying forms, marble versions of the original in bronze of Delos, the Diadumenus, indifferently, mechanically, is binding round his head a ribbon or fillet. In the Vaison copy at the British Museum it was of silver. That simple fillet is, in fact, a diadem, a crown, and he assumes it as a victor; but, as I said, mechanically, and, prize in hand, might be asking himself whether after all it had been worth while. For the active beauty of the Agonistes of which Myron's art is full, we have here, then, the passive beauty of the victor. But the later incident, the realisation of rest, is actually in affinity with a certain earliness, so to call it, in the temper and work of Polycleitus. He is already something of a reactionary; or pauses, rather, to enjoy, to convey enjoyably to others, the full savour of a particular moment in the development of his craft, the moment of the perfecting of restful form, before the mere consciousness of technical mastery in delineation urges forward the art of sculpture to a bewildering infinitude of motion. In opposition to the ease, the freedom, of others, his aim is, by a voluntary restraint in the exercise of such technical mastery, [294] to achieve nothing less than the impeccable, within certain narrow limits. He still hesitates, is self-exacting, seems even to have checked a growing readiness of hand in the artists about him. He was renowned as a graver, found much to do with the chisel, introducing many a fine after-thought, when the rough-casting of his work was over. He studied human form under such conditions as would bring out its natural features, its static laws, in their entirety, their harmony; and in an academic work, so to speak, no longer to be clearly identified in what may be derivations from it, he claimed to have fixed the canon, the common measure, of perfect man. Yet with Polycleitus certainly the measure of man was not yet \"the measure of an angel,\" but still only that of mortal youth; of youth, however, in that scrupulous and uncontaminate purity of form which recommended itself even to the Greeks as befitting messengers from the gods, if such messengers should come. And yet a large part of Myron's contemporary fame depended on his religious work--on his statue of Here, for instance, in ivory and gold--that too, doubtless, expressive, as appropriately to its subject as to himself, of a passive beauty. We see it still, perhaps, in the coins of Argos. And has not the crowned victor, too, in that mechanic action, in his demure attitude, something which reminds us of the religious significance of the Greek athletic service? It was a [295] sort of worship, you know--that department of public life; such worship as Greece, still in its superficial youth, found itself best capable of. At least those solemn contests began and ended with prayer and sacrifice. Their most honoured prizes were a kind of religiously symbolical objects. The athletic life certainly breathes of abstinence, of rule and the keeping under of one's self. And here in the Diadumenus we have one of its priests, a priest of the religion whose central motive was what has been called \"the worship of the body,\"--its modest priest. The so-called Jason at the Louvre, the, Apoxyomenus, and a certain number of others you will meet with from time to time--whatever be the age and derivation of the actual marble which reproduced for Rome, for Africa, or Gaul, types that can have had their first origin in one only time and place--belong, at least aesthetically, to this group, together with the Adorante of Berlin, Winckelmann's antique favourite, who with uplifted face and hands seems to be indeed in prayer, looks immaculate enough to be interceding for others. As to the Jason of the Louvre, one asks at first sight of him, as he stoops to make fast the sandal on his foot, whether the young man can be already so marked a personage. Is he already the approved hero, bent on some great act of his famous epopée; or mere youth only, again, arraying itself mechanically, but alert in eye and soul, prompt to be roused to any [296] great action whatever? The vaguely opened lips certainly suggest the latter view; if indeed the body and the head (in a different sort of marble) really belong to one another. Ah! the more closely you consider the fragments of antiquity, those stray letters of the old Greek aesthetic alphabet, the less positive will your conclusions become, because less conclusive the data regarding artistic origin and purpose. Set here also, however, to the end that in a congruous atmosphere, in a real perspective, they may assume their full moral and aesthetic expression, whatever of like spirit you may come upon in Greek or any other work, remembering that in England also, in Oxford, we have still, for any master of such art that may be given us, subjects truly \"made to his hand.\" As with these, so with their prototypes at Olympia, or at the Isthmus, above all perhaps in the Diadumenus of Polycleitus, a certain melancholy (a pagan melancholy, it may be rightly called, even when we detect it in our English youth) is blent with the final impression we retain of them. They are at play indeed, in the sun; but a little cloud passes over it now and then; and just because of them, because they are there, the whole aspect of the place is chilled suddenly, beyond what one could have thought possible, into what seems, nevertheless, to be the proper and permanent light of day. For though they pass on from age to age the [297] type of what is pleasantest to look on, which, as type, is indeed eternal, it is, of course, but for an hour that it rests with any one of them individually. Assuredly they have no maladies of soul any more than of the body--Animi sensus non expressit. But if they are not yet thinking, there is the capacity of thought, of painful thought, in them, as they seem to be aware wistfully. In the Diadumenus of Polycleitus this expression allies itself to the long-drawn facial type of his preference, to be found also in another very different subject, the ideal of which he fixed in Greek sculpture--the would-be virile Amazon, in exquisite pain, alike of body and soul--the \"Wounded Amazon.\" We may be reminded that in the first mention of athletic contests in Greek literature--in the twenty-third book of the Iliad--they form part of the funeral rites of the hero Patroclus. It is thus, though but in the faintest degree, even with the veritable prince of that world of antique bronze and marble, the Discobolus at Rest of the Vatican, which might well be set where Winckelmann set the Adorante, representing as it probably does, the original of Alcamenes, in whom, a generation after Pheidias, an earlier and more earnest spirit still survived. Although the crisply trimmed head may seem a little too small to our, perhaps not quite rightful, eyes, we might accept him for that canon, or measure, of the perfect human form, which [298] Polycleitus had proposed. He is neither the victor at rest, as with Polycleitus, nor the combatant already in motion, as with Myron; but, as if stepping backward from Myron's precise point ofinterest, and with the heavydiscusstill in the left hand, he is preparing for his venture, taking stand carefully on the right foot. Eye and mind concentre, loyally, entirely, upon the business in hand. The very finger is reckoning while he watches, intent upon the cast of another, as the metal glides to the goal. Take him, to lead you forth quite out of the narrow limits of the Greek world. You have pure humanity there, with a glowing, yet restrained joy and delight in itself, but without vanity; and it is pure. There is nothing certainly supersensual in that fair, round head, any more than in the long, agile limbs; but also no impediment, natural or acquired. To have achieved just that, was the Greek's truest claim for furtherance in the main line of human development. He had been faithful, we cannot help saying, as we pass from that youthful company, in what comparatively is perhaps little--in the culture, the administration, of the visible world; and he merited, so we might go on to say--he merited Revelation, something which should solace his heart in the inevitable fading of that. We are reminded of those strange prophetic words of the Wisdom, the Logos, by whom God made the world, in one of [299] the sapiential, half-Platonic books of the Hebrew Scriptures:--\"I was by him, as one brought up with him; rejoicing in the habitable parts of the earth. My delights were with the sons of men.\"+ NOTES 271. +Transliteration: tymbos amphipolos. Translation: \"a much frequented tomb.\" 274. In some fine reliefs of the thirteenth century, Jesus himself draws near to the deathbed of his Mother. The soul has already quitted her body, and is seated, a tiny crowned figure, on his left arm (as she had carried Him) to be taken to heaven. In the beautiful early fourteenth century monument of Aymer de Valence at Westminster, the soul of the deceased, \"a small figure wrapped in a mantle,\" is supported by two angels at the head of the tomb. Among many similar instances may be mentioned the soul of the beggar, Lazarus, on a carved capital at Vézélay; and the same subject in a coloured window at Bourges. The clean, white little creature seems glad to escape from the body, tattooed all over with its sores in a regular pattern. 279. +Transliteration: Ariston hydôr.

Drake, Ph.D. Electronic Version 1.0 / Date 10-17-01 DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES [1] I DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES, AND [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE E-TEXTS ON THIS SITE ARE PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS-IS\". NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS TO THE E-TEXTS OR ANY MEDIUM THEY MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you may have other legal rights. GREEK STUDIES: A SERIES OF ESSAYS WALTER HORATIO PATER NOTES BY THE E-TEXT EDITOR: Reliability: Although I have done my best to ensure that the text you read is error-free in comparison with an exact reprint of the standard edition--Macmillan's 1910 Library Edition--please exercise scholarly caution in using it. It is not intended as a substitute for the printed original but rather as a searchable supplement. My e-texts may prove convenient substitutes for hard-to-get works in a course where both instructor and students accept the possibility of some imperfections in the text, but if you are writing a scholarly article, dissertation, or book, you should use the standard hard-copy editions of any works you cite. Pagination and Paragraphing: To avoid an unwieldy electronic copy, I have transferred original pagination to brackets. A bracketed numeral such as [22] indicates that the material immediately following the number marks the beginning of the relevant page.

SHADWELL [1] THE present volume consists of a collection of essays by the late Mr. Pater, all of which have already been given to the public in various Magazines; and it is owing to the kindness of the several proprietors of those Magazines that they can now be brought together in a collected shape. It will, it is believed, be felt, that their value is considerably enhanced by their appearance in a single volume, where they can throw light upon one another, and exhibit by their connexion a more complete view of the scope and purpose of Mr. Pater in dealing with the art and literature of the ancient world. The essays fall into two distinct groups, one dealing with the subjects of Greek mythology and Greek poetry, the other with the history of Greek sculpture and Greek architecture. But these two groups are not wholly distinct; they mutually illustrate one another, and serve to enforce Mr. Pater's conception of the essential [2] unity, in all its many-sidedness, of the Greek character. The god understood as the \"spiritual form\" of the things of nature is not only the key-note of the \"Study of Dionysus\"* and \"The Myth of Demeter and Persephone,\"* but reappears as contributing to the interpretation of the growth of Greek sculpture.* Thus, though in the bibliography of his writings, the two groups are separated by a considerable interval, there is no change of view; he had already reached the centre of the problem, and, the secret once gained, his mode of treatment of the different aspects of Greek life and thought is permanent and consistent. The essay on \"The Myth of Demeter and Persephone\" was originally prepared as two lectures, for delivery, in 1875, at the Birmingham and Midland Institute. These lectures were published in the Fortnightly Review, in Jan. and Feb. 1876. The \"Study of Dionysus\" appeared in the same Review in Dec. 1876. \"The Bacchanals of Euripides\" must have been written about the same time, as a sequel to the \"Study of Dionysus\"; for, in 1878, Mr. Pater revised the four essays, with the intention, apparently, of publishing them collectively in a volume, an intention afterwards abandoned. [3] The text now printed has, except that of \"The Bacchanals,\" been taken from proofs then set up, further corrected in manuscript. \"The Bacchanals,\" written long before, was not published until 1889, when it appeared in Macmillan's Magazine for May. It was reprinted, without alteration, prefixed to Dr. Tyrrell's edition of the Bacchae. \"Hippolytus Veiled\" first appeared in August 1889, in Macmillan's Magazine. It was afterwards rewritten, but with only a few substantial alterations, in Mr. Pater's own hand, with a view, probably, of republishing it with other essays. This last revise has been followed in the text now printed. The papers on Greek sculpture* are all that remain of a series which, if Mr. Pater had lived, would, probably, have grown into a still more important work. Such a work would have included one or more essays on Phidias and the Parthenon, of which only a fragment, though an important fragment, can be found amongst his papers; and it was to have been prefaced by an Introduction to Greek Studies, only a page or two of which was ever written. [4] This is not the place to speak of Mr. Pater's private virtues, the personal charm of his character, the brightness of his talk, the warmth of his friendship, the devotion of his family life. But a few words may be permitted on the value of the work by which he will be known to those who never saw him. Persons only superficially acquainted, or by hearsay, with his writings, are apt to sum up his merits as a writer by saying that he was a master, or a consummate master of style; but those who have really studied what he wrote do not need to be told that his distinction does not lie in his literary grace alone, his fastidious choice of language, his power of word-painting, but in the depth and seriousness of his studies. That the amount he has produced, in a literary life of thirty years, is not greater, is one proof among many of the spirit in which he worked. His genius was \"an infinite capacity for taking pains.\" That delicacy of insight, that gift of penetrating into the heart of things, that subtleness of interpretation, which with him seems an instinct, is the outcome of hard, patient, conscientious study. If he had chosen, he might, without difficulty, have produced a far greater body of work of less value; and from a worldly point of view, he would have been wise. Such was not his understanding [5] of the use of his talents. Cui multum datum est, multum quaeretur ab eo. Those who wish to understand the spirit in which he worked, will find it in this volume.

A STUDY OF DIONYSUS: THE SPIRITUAL FORM OF FIRE AND DEW [9] WRITERS on mythology speak habitually of the religion of the Greeks. In thus speaking, they are really using a misleading expression, and should speak rather of religions; each race and class of Greeks--the Dorians, the people of the coast, the fishers--having had a religion of its own, conceived of the objects that came nearest to it and were most in its thoughts, and the resulting usages and ideas never having come to have a precisely harmonised system, after the analogy of some other religions. The religion of Dionysus is the religion of people who pass their lives among the vines. As the religion of Demeter carries us back to the cornfields and farmsteads of Greece, and places us, in fancy, among a primitive race, in the furrow and beside the granary; so the religion of Dionysus carries us back to its vineyards, and is a monument of the ways and thoughts of people whose days go by beside the winepress, and [10] under the green and purple shadows, and whose material happiness depends on the crop of grapes. For them the thought of Dionysus and his circle, a little Olympus outside the greater, covered the whole of life, and was a complete religion, a sacred representation or interpretation of the whole human experience, modified by the special limitations, the special privileges of insight or suggestion, incident to their peculiar mode of existence. Now, if the reader wishes to understand what the scope of the religion of Dionysus was to the Greeks who lived in it, all it represented to them by way of one clearly conceived yet complex symbol, let him reflect what the loss would be if all the effect and expression drawn from the imagery of the vine and the cup fell out of the whole body of existing poetry; how many fascinating trains of reflexion, what colour and substance would therewith have been deducted from it, filled as it is, apart from the more aweful associations of the Christian ritual, apart from Galahad's cup, with all the various symbolism of the fruit of the vine. That supposed loss is but an imperfect measure of all that the name of Dionysus recalled to the Greek mind, under a single imaginable form, an outward body of flesh presented to the senses, and comprehending, as its animating soul, a whole world of thoughts, surmises, greater and less experiences. [11] The student of the comparative science of religions finds in the religion of Dionysus one of many modes of that primitive tree-worship which, growing out of some universal instinctive belief that trees and flowers are indeed habitations of living spirits, is found almost everywhere in the earlier stages of civilisation, enshrined in legend or custom, often graceful enough, as if the delicate beauty of the object of worship had effectually taken hold on the fancy of the worshipper. Shelley's Sensitive Plant shows in what mists of poetical reverie such feeling may still float about a mind full of modern lights, the feeling we too have of a life in the green world, always ready to assert its claim over our sympathetic fancies. Who has not at moments felt the scruple, which is with us always regarding animal life, following the signs of animation further still, till one almost hesitates to pluck out the little soul of flower or leaf? And in so graceful a faith the Greeks had their share; what was crude and inane in it becoming, in the atmosphere of their energetic, imaginative intelligence, refined and humanised. The oak-grove of Dodona, the seat of their most venerable oracle, did but perpetuate the fancy that the sounds of the wind in the trees may be, for certain prepared and chosen ears, intelligible voices; they could believe in the transmigration of souls into mulberry and laurel, mint and hyacinth; and the dainty Metamorphoses of Ovid [12] are but a fossilised form of one morsel here and there, from a whole world of transformation, with which their nimble fancy was perpetually playing. \"Together with them,\" says the Homeric hymn to Aphrodite, of the Hamadryads, the nymphs which animate the forest trees, \"with them, at the moment of their birth, grew up out of the soil, oak-tree or pine, fair, flourishing among the mountains. And when at last the appointed hour of their death has come, first of all, those fair trees are dried up; the bark perishes from around them, and the branches fall away; and therewith the soul of them deserts the light of the sun.\"+ These then are the nurses of the vine, bracing it with interchange of sun and shade. They bathe, they dance, they sing songs of enchantment, so that those who seem oddly in love with nature, and strange among their fellows, are still said to be nympholepti; above all, they are weavers or spinsters, spinning or weaving with airiest fingers, and subtlest, many-coloured threads, the foliage of the trees, the petals of flowers, the skins of the fruit, the long thin stalks on which the poplar leaves are set so lightly that Homer compares to them, in their constant motion, the maids who sit spinning in the house of Alcinous. The nymphs of Naxos, where the grape-skin is darkest, weave for him a purple robe. Only, the ivy is never transformed, is visible as natural ivy to the last, pressing the [13] dark outline of its leaves close upon the firm, white, quite human flesh of the god's forehead. In its earliest form, then, the religion of Dionysus presents us with the most graceful phase of this graceful worship, occupying a place between the ruder fancies of half-civilised people concerning life in flower or tree, and the dreamy after-fancies of the poet of the Sensitive Plant. He is the soul of the individual vine, first; the young vine at the house-door of the newly married, for instance, as the vine-grower stoops over it, coaxing and nursing it, like a pet animal or a little child; afterwards, the soul of the whole species, the spirit of fire and dew, alive and leaping in a thousand vines, as the higher intelligence, brooding more deeply over things, pursues, in thought, the generation of sweetness and strength in the veins of the tree, the transformation of water into wine, little by little; noting all the influences upon it of the heaven above and the earth beneath; and shadowing forth, in each pause of the process, an intervening person--what is to us but the secret chemistry of nature being to them the mediation of living spirits. So they passed on to think of Dionysus (naming him at last from the brightness of the sky and the moisture of the earth) not merely as the soul of the vine, but of all that life in flowing things of which the vine is the symbol, because its most emphatic example. At Delos he bears a son, from whom [14] in turn spring the three mysterious sisters Oeno, Spermo, and Elais, who, dwelling in the island, exercise respectively the gifts of turning all things at will into oil, and corn, and wine. In the Bacchae of Euripides, he gives his followers, by miracle, honey and milk, and the water gushes for them from the smitten rock. He comes at last to have a scope equal to that of Demeter, a realm as wide and mysterious as hers; the whole productive power of the earth is in him, and the explanation of its annual change. As some embody their intuitions of that power in corn, so others in wine. He is the dispenser of the earth's hidden wealth, giver of riches through the vine, as Demeter through the grain. And as Demeter sends the airy, dainty-wheeled and dainty-winged spirit of Triptolemus to bear her gifts abroad on all winds, so Dionysus goes on his eastern journey, with its many intricate adventures, on which he carries his gifts to every people. A little Olympus outside the greater, I said, of Dionysus and his companions; he is the centre of a cycle, the hierarchy of the creatures of water and sunlight in many degrees; and that fantastic system of tree-worship places round him, not the fondly whispering spirits of the more graceful inhabitants of woodland only, the nymphs of the poplar and the pine, but the whole satyr circle, intervening between the headship of the vine and the mere earth, the grosser, less human [15] spirits, incorporate and made visible, of the more coarse and sluggish sorts of vegetable strength, the fig, the reed, the ineradicable weed-things which will attach themselves, climbing about the vine-poles, or seeking the sun between the hot stones. For as Dionysus, the spiritual form of the vine, is of the highest human type, so the fig-tree and the reed have animal souls, mistakeable in the thoughts of a later, imperfectly remembering age, for mere abstractions of animal nature; Snubnose, and Sweetwine, and Silenus, the oldest of them all, so old that he has come to have the gift of prophecy. Quite different from them in origin and intent, but confused with them in form, are those other companions of Dionysus, Pan and his children. Home-spun dream of simple people, and like them in the uneventful tenour of his existence, he has almost no story; he is but a presence; the spiritual form of Arcadia, and the ways of human life there; the reflexion, in sacred image or ideal, of its flocks, and orchards, and wild honey; the dangers of its hunters; its weariness in noonday heat; its children, agile as the goats they tend, who run, in their picturesque rags, across the solitary wanderer's path, to startle him, in the unfamiliar upper places; its one adornment and solace being the dance to the homely shepherd's pipe, cut by Pan first from the sedges of the brook Molpeia. Breathing of remote nature, the sense of which [16] is so profound in the Homeric hymn to Pan, the pines, the foldings of the hills, the leaping streams, the strange echoings and dying of sound on the heights, \"the bird, which among the petals of many-flowered spring, pouring out a dirge, sends forth her honey-voiced song,\" \"the crocus and the hyacinth disorderly mixed in the deep grass\"+--things which the religion of Dionysus loves--Pan joins the company of the Satyrs. Amongst them, they give their names to insolence and mockery, and the finer sorts of malice, to unmeaning and ridiculous fear. But the best spirits have found in them also a certain human pathos, as in displaced beings, coming even nearer to most men, in their very roughness, than the noble and delicate person of the vine; dubious creatures, half-way between the animal and human kinds, speculating wistfully on their being, because not wholly understanding themselves and their place in nature; as the animals seem always to have this expression to some noticeable degree in the presence of man. In the later school of Attic sculpture they are treated with more and more of refinement, till in some happy moment Praxiteles conceived a model, often repeated, which concentrates this sentiment of true humour concerning them; a model of dainty natural ease in posture, but with the legs slightly crossed, as only lowly-bred gods are used to carry them, and with some puzzled trouble of youth, you might wish for a moment [17] to smoothe away, puckering the forehead a little, between the pointed ears, on which the goodly hair of his animal strength grows low. Little by little, the signs of brute nature are subordinated, or disappear; and at last, Robetta, a humble Italian engraver of the fifteenth century, entering into the Greek fancy because it belongs to all ages, has expressed it in its most exquisite form, in a design of Ceres and her children, of whom their mother is no longer afraid, as in the Homeric hymn to Pan. The puck- noses have grown delicate, so that, with Plato's infatuated lover, you may call them winsome, if you please; and no one would wish those hairy little shanks away, with which one of the small Pans walks at her side, grasping her skirt stoutly; while the other, the sick or weary one, rides in the arms of Ceres herself, who in graceful Italian dress, and decked airily with fruit and corn, steps across a country of cut sheaves, pressing it closely to her, with a child's peevish trouble in its face, and its small goat-legs and tiny hoofs folded over together, precisely after the manner of a little child. There is one element in the conception of Dionysus, which his connexion with the satyrs, Marsyas being one of them, and with Pan, from whom the flute passed to all the shepherds of Theocritus, alike illustrates, his interest, namely, in one of the great species of music. One form of that wilder vegetation, of which the Satyr race is the soul made visible, is the reed, which [18] the creature plucks and trims into musical pipes. And as Apollo inspires and rules over all the music of strings, so Dionysus inspires and rules over all the music of the reed, the water-plant, in which the ideas of water and of vegetable life are brought close together, natural property, therefore, of the spirit of life in the green sap. I said that the religion of Dionysus was, for those who lived in it, a complete religion, a complete sacred representation and interpretation of the whole of life; and as, in his relation to the vine, he fills for them the place of Demeter, is the life of the earth through the grape as she through the grain, so, in this other phase of his being, in his relation to the reed, he fills for them the place of Apollo; he is the inherent cause of music and poetry; he inspires; he explains the phenomena of enthusiasm, as distinguished by Plato in the Phaedrus, the secrets of possession by a higher and more energetic spirit than one's own, the gift of self-revelation, of passing out of oneself through words, tones, gestures. A winged Dionysus, venerated at Amyclae, was perhaps meant to represent him thus, as the god of enthusiasm, of the rising up on those spiritual wings, of which also we hear something in the Phaedrus of Plato. The artists of the Renaissance occupied themselves much with the person and the story of Dionysus; and Michelangelo, in a work still remaining in Florence, in which he essayed [19] with success to produce a thing which should pass with the critics for a piece of ancient sculpture, has represented him in the fulness, as it seems, of this enthusiasm, an image of delighted, entire surrender to transporting dreams. And this is no subtle after-thought of a later age, but true to certain finer movements of old Greek sentiment, though it may seem to have waited for the hand of Michelangelo before it attained complete realisation. The head of Ion leans, as they recline at the banquet, on the shoulder of Charmides; he mutters in his sleep of things seen therein, but awakes as the flute-players enter, whom Charmides has hired for his birthday supper. The soul of Callias, who sits on the other side of Charmides, flashes out; he counterfeits, with life-like gesture, the personal tricks of friend or foe; or the things he could never utter before, he finds words for now; the secrets of life are on his lips. It is in this loosening of the lips and heart, strictly, that Dionysus is the Deliverer, Eleutherios; and of such enthusiasm, or ecstasy, is, in a certain sense, an older patron than Apollo himself. Even at Delphi, the centre of Greek inspiration and of the religion of Apollo, his claim always maintained itself; and signs are not wanting that Apollo was but a later comer there. There, under his later reign, hard by the golden image of Apollo himself, near the sacred tripod on which the Pythia sat to prophesy, was to be seen a strange object--a sort [20] of coffin or cinerary urn with the inscription, \"Here lieth the body of Dionysus, the son of Semele.\" The pediment of the great temple was divided between them--Apollo with the nine Muses on that side, Dionysus, with perhaps three times three Graces, on this. A third of the whole year was held sacred to him; the four winter months were the months of Dionysus; and in the shrine of Apollo itself he was worshipped with almost equal devotion. The religion of Dionysus takes us back, then, into that old Greek life of the vineyards, as we see it on many painted vases, with much there as we should find it now, as we see it in Bennozzo Gozzoli's mediaeval fresco of the Invention of Wine in the Campo Santo at Pisa- -the family of Noah presented among all the circumstances of a Tuscan vineyard, around the press from which the first wine is flowing, a painted idyll, with its vintage colours still opulent in decay, and not without its solemn touch of biblical symbolism. For differences, we detect in that primitive life, and under that Greek sky, a nimbler play of fancy, lightly and unsuspiciously investing all things with personal aspect and incident, and a certain mystical apprehension, now almost departed, of unseen powers beyond the material veil of things, corresponding to the exceptional vigour and variety of the Greek organisation. This peasant life lies, in unhistoric time, behind the definite forms with which poetry and a refined [21] priesthood afterwards clothed the religion of Dionysus; and the mere scenery and circumstances of the vineyard have determined many things in its development. The noise of the vineyard still sounds in some of his epithets, perhaps in his best-known name--Iacchus, Bacchus. The masks suspended on base or cornice, so familiar an ornament in later Greek architecture, are the little faces hanging from the vines, and moving in the wind, to scare the birds. That garland of ivy, the aesthetic value of which is so great in the later imagery of Dionysus and his descendants, the leaves of which, floating from his hair, become so noble in the hands of Titian and Tintoret, was actually worn on the head for coolness; his earliest and most sacred images were wrought in the wood of the vine. The people of the vineyard had their feast, the little or country Dionysia, which still lived on, side by side with the greater ceremonies of a later time, celebrated in December, the time of the storing of the new wine. It was then that the potters' fair came, calpis and amphora, together with lamps against the winter, laid out in order for the choice of buyers; for Keramus, the Greek Vase, is a son of Dionysus, of wine and of Athene, who teaches men all serviceable and decorative art. Then the goat was killed, and its blood poured out at the root of the vines; and Dionysus literally drank the blood of goats; and, being Greeks, with quick and mobile sympathies, [22] deisidaimones,+ \"superstitious,\" or rather \"susceptible of religious impressions,\" some among them, remembering those departed since last year, add yet a little more, and a little wine and water for the dead also; brooding how the sense of these things might pass below the roots, to spirits hungry and thirsty, perhaps, in their shadowy homes. But the gaiety, that gaiety which Aristophanes in the Acharnians has depicted with so many vivid touches, as a thing of which civil war had deprived the villages of Attica, preponderates over the grave. The travelling country show comes round with its puppets; even the slaves have their holiday;* the mirth becomes excessive; they hide their faces under grotesque masks of bark, or stain them with wine-lees, or potters' crimson even, like the old rude idols painted red; and carry in midnight procession such rough symbols of the productive force of nature as the women and children had best not look upon; which will be frowned upon, and refine themselves, or disappear, in the feasts of cultivated Athens. Of the whole story of Dionysus, it was the episode of his marriage with Ariadne about which ancient art concerned itself oftenest, and with most effect. Here, although the antiquarian [23] may still detect circumstances which link the persons and incidents of the legend with the mystical life of the earth, as symbols of its annual change, yet the merely human interest of the story has prevailed over its earlier significance; the spiritual form of fire and dew has become a romantic lover. And as a story of romantic love, fullest perhaps of all the motives of classic legend of the pride of life, it survived with undiminished interest to a later world, two of the greatest masters of Italian painting having poured their whole power into it; Titian with greater space of ingathered shore and mountain, and solemn foliage, and fiery animal life; Tintoret with profounder luxury of delight in the nearness to each other, and imminent embrace, of glorious bodily presences; and both alike with consummate beauty of physical form. Hardly less humanised is the Theban legend of Dionysus, the legend of his birth from Semele, which, out of the entire body of tradition concerning him, was accepted as central by the Athenian imagination. For the people of Attica, he comes from Boeotia, a country of northern marsh and mist, but from whose sombre, black marble towns came also the vine, the musical reed cut from its sedges, and the worship of the Graces, always so closely connected with the religion of Dionysus. \"At Thebes alone,\" says Sophocles, \"mortal women bear immortal gods.\" His mother is the daughter of Cadmus, himself marked out by [24] many curious circumstances as the close kinsman of the earth, to which he all but returns at last, as the serpent, in his old age, attesting some closer sense lingering there of the affinity of man with the dust from whence he came. Semele, an old Greek word, as it seems, for the surface of the earth, the daughter of Cadmus, beloved by Zeus, desires to see her lover in the glory with which he is seen by the immortal Hera. He appears to her in lightning. But the mortal may not behold him and live. Semele gives premature birth to the child Dionysus; whom, to preserve it from the jealousy of Hera, Zeus hides in a part of his thigh, the child returning into the loins of its father, whence in due time it is born again. Yet in this fantastic story, hardly less than in the legend of Ariadne, the story of Dionysus has become a story of human persons, with human fortunes, and even more intimately human appeal to sympathy; so that Euripides, pre-eminent as a poet of pathos, finds in it a subject altogether to his mind. All the interest now turns on the development of its points of moral or sentimental significance; the love of the immortal for the mortal, the presumption of the daughter of man who desires to see the divine form as it is; on the fact that not without loss of sight, or life itself, can man look upon it. The travail of nature has been transformed into the pangs of the human mother; and the poet dwells much on the pathetic incident of death in childbirth, making [25] Dionysus, as Callimachus calls him, a seven months' child, cast out among its enemies, motherless. And as a consequence of this human interest, the legend attaches itself, as in an actual history, to definite sacred objects and places, the venerable relic of the wooden image which fell into the chamber of Semele with the lightning-flash, and which the piety of a later age covered with plates of brass; the Ivy- Fountain near Thebes, the water of which was so wonderfully bright and sweet to drink, where the nymphs bathed the new-born child; the grave of Semele, in a sacred enclosure grown with ancient vines, where some volcanic heat or flame was perhaps actually traceable, near the lightning-struck ruins of her supposed abode. Yet, though the mystical body of the earth is forgotten in the human anguish of the mother of Dionysus, the sense of his essence of fire and dew still lingers in his most sacred name, as the son of Semele, Dithyrambus. We speak of a certain wild music in words or rhythm as dithyrambic, like the dithyrambus, that is, the wild choral-singing of the worshippers of Dionysus. But Dithyrambus seems to have been, in the first instance, the name, not of the hymn, but of the god to whom the hymn is sung; and, through a tangle of curious etymological speculations as to the precise derivation of this name, one thing seems clearly visible, that it commemorates, namely, the double birth of the vine-god; that [26] he is born once and again; his birth, first of fire, and afterwards of dew; the two dangers that beset him; his victory over two enemies, the capricious, excessive heats and colds of spring. He is pyrigenês,+ then, fire-born, the son of lightning; lightning being to light, as regards concentration, what wine is to the other strengths of the earth. And who that has rested a hand on the glittering silex of a vineyard slope in August, where the pale globes of sweetness are lying, does not feel this? It is out of the bitter salts of a smitten, volcanic soil that it comes up with the most curious virtues. The mother faints and is parched up by the heat which brings the child to the birth; and it pierces through, a wonder of freshness, drawing its everlasting green and typical coolness out of the midst of the ashes; its own stem becoming at last like a tangled mass of tortured metal. In thinking of Dionysus, then, as fire-born, the Greeks apprehend and embody the sentiment, the poetry, of all tender things which grow out of a hard soil, or in any sense blossom before the leaf, like the little mezereon-plant of English gardens, with its pale-purple, wine-scented flowers upon the leafless twigs in February, or like the almond-trees of Tuscany, or Aaron's rod that budded, or the staff in the hand of the Pope when Tannhäuser's repentance is accepted. And his second birth is of the dew. The fire of which he was born would destroy him in [27] his turn, as it withered up his mother; a second danger comes; from this the plant is protected by the influence of the cooling cloud, the lower part of his father the sky, in which it is wrapped and hidden, and of which it is born again, its second mother being, in some versions of the legend, Hyé--the Dew. The nursery, where Zeus places it to be brought up, is a cave in Mount Nysa, sought by a misdirected ingenuity in many lands, but really, like the place of the carrying away of Persephone, a place of fantasy, the oozy place of springs in the hollow of the hillside, nowhere and everywhere, where the vine was \"invented.\" The nymphs of the trees overshadow it from above; the nymphs of the springs sustain it from below--the Hyades, those first leaping maenads, who, as the springs become rain-clouds, go up to heaven among the stars, and descend again, as dew or shower, upon it; so that the religion of Dionysus connects itself, not with tree-worship only, but also with ancient water-worship, the worship of the spiritual forms of springs and streams. To escape from his enemies Dionysus leaps into the sea, the original of all rain and springs, whence, in early summer, the women of Elis and Argos were wont to call him, with the singing of a hymn. And again, in thus commemorating Dionysus as born of the dew, the Greeks apprehend and embody the sentiment, the poetry, of water. For not the heat only, but its solace--the freshness of the [28] cup- -this too was felt by those people of the vineyard, whom the prophet Melampus had taught to mix always their wine with water, and with whom the watering of the vines became a religious ceremony; the very dead, as they thought, drinking of and refreshed by the stream. And who that has ever felt the heat of a southern country does not know this poetry, the motive of the loveliest of all the works attributed to Giorgione, the Fête Champêtre in the Louvre; the intense sensations, the subtle and far-reaching symbolisms, which, in these places, cling about the touch and sound and sight of it? Think of the darkness of the well in the breathless court, with the delicate ring of ferns kept alive just within the opening; of the sound of the fresh water flowing through the wooden pipes into the houses of Venice, on summer mornings; of the cry Acqua frésca! at Padua or Verona, when the people run to buy what they prize, in its rare purity, more than wine, bringing pleasures so full of exquisite appeal to the imagination, that, in these streets, the very beggars, one thinks, might exhaust all the philosophy of the epicurean. Out of all these fancies comes the vine-growers' god, the spiritual form of fire and dew. Beyond the famous representations of Dionysus in later art and poetry--the Bacchanals of Euripides, the statuary of the school of Praxiteles--a multitude of literary allusions and local [29] customs carry us back to this world of vision unchecked by positive knowledge, in which the myth is begotten among a primitive people, as they wondered over the life of the thing their hands helped forward, till it became for them a kind of spirit, and their culture of it a kind of worship. Dionysus, as we see him in art and poetry, is the projected expression of the ways and dreams of this primitive people, brooded over and harmonised by the energetic Greek imagination; the religious imagination of the Greeks being, precisely, a unifying or identifying power, bringing together things naturally asunder, making, as it were, for the human body a soul of waters, for the human soul a body of flowers; welding into something like the identity of a human personality the whole range of man's experiences of a given object, or series of objects--all their outward qualities, and the visible facts regarding them--all the hidden ordinances by which those facts and qualities hold of unseen forces, and have their roots in purely visionary places. Dionysus came later than the other gods to the centres of Greek life; and, as a consequence of this, he is presented to us in an earlier stage of development than they; that element of natural fact which is the original essence of all mythology being more unmistakeably impressed upon us here than in other myths. Not the least interesting point in the study of him is, that he illustrates very clearly, not only the [30] earlier, but also a certain later influence of this element of natural fact, in the development of the gods of Greece. For the physical sense, latent in it, is the clue, not merely to the original signification of the incidents of the divine story, but also to the source of the peculiar imaginative expression which its persons subsequently retain, in the forms of the higher Greek sculpture. And this leads me to some general thoughts on the relation of Greek sculpture to mythology, which may help to explain what the function of the imagination in Greek sculpture really was, in its handling of divine persons. That Zeus is, in earliest, original, primitive intention, the open sky, across which the thunder sometimes sounds, and from which the rain descends--is a fact which not only explains the various stories related concerning him, but determines also the expression which he retained in the work of Pheidias, so far as it is possible to recall it, long after the growth of those later stories had obscured, for the minds of his worshippers, his primary signification. If men felt, as Arrian tells us, that it was a calamity to die without having seen the Zeus of Olympia; that was because they experienced the impress there of that which the eye and the whole being of man love to find above him; and the genius of Pheidias had availed to shed, upon the gold and ivory of the physical form, the blandness, the breadth, the smile of the open sky; the mild [31] heat of it still coming and going, in the face of the father of all the children of sunshine and shower; as if one of the great white clouds had composed itself into it, and looked down upon them thus, out of the midsummer noonday: so that those things might be felt as warm, and fresh, and blue, by the young and the old, the weak and the strong, who came to sun themselves in the god's presence, as procession and hymn rolled on, in the fragrant and tranquil courts of the great Olympian temple; while all the time those people consciously apprehended in the carved image of Zeus none but the personal, and really human, characteristics. Or think, again, of the Zeus of Dodona. The oracle of Dodona, with its dim grove of oaks, and sounding instruments of brass to husband the faintest whisper in the leaves, was but a great consecration of that sense of a mysterious will, of which people still feel, or seem to feel, the expression, in the motions of the wind, as it comes and goes, and which makes it, indeed, seem almost more than a mere symbol of the spirit within us. For Zeus was, indeed, the god of the winds also; Aeolus, their so-called god, being only his mortal minister, as having come, by long study of them, through signs in the fire and the like, to have a certain communicable skill regarding them, in relation to practical uses. Now, suppose a Greek sculptor to have proposed to himself to present [32] to his worshippers the image of this Zeus of Dodona, who is in the trees and on the currents of the air. Then, if he had been a really imaginative sculptor, working as Pheidias worked, the very soul of those moving, sonorous creatures would have passed through his hand, into the eyes and hair of the image; as they can actually pass into the visible expression of those who have drunk deeply of them; as we may notice, sometimes, in our walks on mountain or shore. Victory again--Niké--associated so often with Zeus--on the top of his staff, on the foot of his throne, on the palm of his extended hand-- meant originally, mythologic science tells us, only the great victory of the sky, the triumph of morning over darkness. But that physical morning of her origin has its ministry to the later aesthetic sense also. For if Niké, when she appears in company with the mortal, and wholly fleshly hero, in whose chariot she stands to guide the horses, or whom she crowns with her garland of parsley or bay, or whose names she writes on a shield, is imaginatively conceived, it is because the old skyey influences are still not quite suppressed in her clear-set eyes, and the dew of the morning still clings to her wings and her floating hair. The office of the imagination, then, in Greek sculpture, in its handling of divine persons, is thus to condense the impressions of natural things into human form; to retain that early mystical sense of water, or wind, or light, in the [33] moulding of eye and brow; to arrest it, or rather, perhaps, to set it free, there, as human expression. The body of man, indeed, was for the Greeks, still the genuine work of Prometheus; its connexion with earth and air asserted in many a legend, not shaded down, as with us, through innumerable stages of descent, but direct and immediate; in precise contrast to our physical theory of our life, which never seems to fade, dream over it as we will, out of the light of common day. The oracles with their messages to human intelligence from birds and springs of water, or vapours of the earth, were a witness to that connexion. Their story went back, as they believed, with unbroken continuity, and in the very places where their later life was lived, to a past, stretching beyond, yet continuous with, actual memory, in which heaven and earth mingled; to those who were sons and daughters of stars, and streams, and dew; to an ancestry of grander men and women, actually clothed in, or incorporate with, the qualities and influences of those objects; and we can hardly over-estimate the influence on the Greek imagination of this mythical connexion with the natural world, at not so remote a date, and of the solemnising power exercised thereby over their thoughts. In this intensely poetical situation, the historical Greeks, the Athenians of the age of Pericles, found themselves; it was as if the actual roads on which men daily walk, went up and on, into a visible wonderland. [34] With such habitual impressions concerning the body, the physical nature of man, the Greek sculptor, in his later day, still free in imagination, through the lingering influence of those early dreams, may have more easily infused into human form the sense of sun, or lightning, or cloud, to which it was so closely akin, the spiritual flesh allying itself happily to mystical meanings, and readily expressing seemingly unspeakable qualities. But the human form is a limiting influence also; and in proportion as art impressed human form, in sculpture or in the drama, on the vaguer conceptions of the Greek mind, there was danger of an escape from them of the free spirit of air, and light, and sky. Hence, all through the history of Greek art, there is a struggle, a Streben, as the Germans say, between the palpable and limited human form, and the floating essence it is to contain. On the one hand, was the teeming, still fluid world, of old beliefs, as we see it reflected in the somewhat formless theogony of Hesiod; a world, the Titanic vastness of which is congruous with a certain sublimity of speech, when he has to speak, for instance, of motion or space; as the Greek language itself has a primitive copiousness and energy of words, for wind, fire, water, cold, sound--attesting a deep susceptibility to the impressions of those things--yet with edges, most often, melting into each other. On the other hand, there was that limiting, controlling tendency, [35] identified with the Dorian influence in the history of the Greek mind, the spirit of a severe and wholly self-conscious intelligence; bent on impressing everywhere, in the products of the imagination, the definite, perfectly conceivable human form, as the only worthy subject of art; less in sympathy with the mystical genealogies of Hesiod, than with the heroes of Homer, ending in the entirely humanised religion of Apollo, the clearly understood humanity of the old Greek warriors in the marbles of Aegina. The representation of man, as he is or might be, became the aim of sculpture, and the achievement of this the subject of its whole history; one early carver had opened the eyes, another the lips, a third had given motion to the feet; in various ways, in spite of the retention of archaic idols, the genuine human expression had come, with the truthfulness of life itself. These two tendencies, then, met and struggled and were harmonised in the supreme imagination, of Pheidias, in sculpture--of Aeschylus, in the drama. Hence, a series of wondrous personalities, of which the Greek imagination became the dwelling-place; beautiful, perfectly understood human outlines, embodying a strange, delightful, lingering sense of clouds and water and sun. Such a world, the world of really imaginative Greek sculpture, we still see, reflected in many a humble vase or battered coin, in Bacchante, and Centaur, and Amazon; [36] evolved out of that \"vasty deep\"; with most command, in the consummate fragments of the Parthenon; not, indeed, so that he who runs may read, the gifts of Greek sculpture being always delicate, and asking much of the receiver; but yet visible, and a pledge to us, of creative power, as, to the worshipper, of the presence, which, without that material pledge, had but vaguely haunted the fields and groves. This, then, was what the Greek imagination did for men's sense and experience of natural forces, in Athene, in Zeus, in Poseidon; for men's sense and experience of their own bodily qualities--swiftness, energy, power of concentrating sight and hand and foot on a momentary physical act--in the close hair, the chastened muscle, the perfectly poised attention of the quoit-player; for men's sense, again, of ethical qualities--restless idealism, inward vision, power of presence through that vision in scenes behind the experience of ordinary men--in the idealised Alexander. To illustrate this function of the imagination, as especially developed in Greek art, we may reflect on what happens with us in the use of certain names, as expressing summarily, this name for you and that for me--Helen, Gretchen, Mary--a hundred associations, trains of sound, forms, impressions, remembered in all sorts of degrees, which, through a very wide and full experience, they have the power of bringing with [37] them; in which respect, such names are but revealing instances of the whole significance, power, and use of language in general. Well,--the mythical conception, projected at last, in drama or sculpture, is the name, the instrument of the identification, of the given matter,--of its unity in variety, its outline or definition in mystery; its spiritual form, to use again the expression I have borrowed from William Blake--form, with hands, and lips, and opened eyelids--spiritual, as conveying to us, in that, the soul of rain, or of a Greek river, or of swiftness, or purity. To illustrate this, think what the effect would be, if you could associate, by some trick of memory, a certain group of natural objects, in all their varied perspective, their changes of colour and tone in varying light and shade, with the being and image of an actual person. You travelled through a country of clear rivers and wide meadows, or of high windy places, or of lowly grass and willows, or of the Lady of the Lake; and all the complex impressions of these objects wound themselves, as a second animated body, new and more subtle, around the person of some one left there, so that they no longer come to recollection apart from each other. Now try to conceive the image of an actual person, in whom, somehow, all those impressions of the vine and its fruit, as the highest type of the life of the green sap, had become incorporate;--all the scents and colours of its flower and fruit, and [38] something of its curling foliage; the chances of its growth; the enthusiasm, the easy flow of more choice expression, as its juices mount within one; for the image is eloquent, too, in word, gesture, and glancing of the eyes, which seem to be informed by some soul of the vine within it: as Wordsworth says, Beauty born of murmuring sound Shall pass into her face-- so conceive an image into which the beauty, \"born\" of the vine, has passed; and you have the idea of Dionysus, as he appears, entirely fashioned at last by central Greek poetry and art, and is consecrated in the Oinophoria and the Anthestêria,+ the great festivals of the Winepress and the Flowers. The word wine, and with it the germ of the myth of Dionysus, is older than the separation of the Indo-Germanic race. Yet, with the people of Athens, Dionysus counted as the youngest of the gods; he was also the son of a mortal, dead in childbirth, and seems always to have exercised the charm of the latest born, in a sort of allowable fondness. Through the fine-spun speculations of modern ethnologists and grammarians, noting the changes in the letters of his name, and catching at the slightest historical records of his worship, we may trace his coming from Phrygia, the birthplace of the more mystical elements of [39] Greek religion, over the mountains of Thrace. On the heights of Pangaeus he leaves an oracle, with a perpetually burning fire, famous down to the time of Augustus, who reverently visited it. Southwards still, over the hills of Parnassus, which remained for the inspired women of Boeotia the centre of his presence, he comes to Thebes, and the family of Cadmus. From Boeotia he passes to Attica; to the villages first; at last to Athens; at an assignable date, under Peisistratus; out of the country, into the town. To this stage of his town-life, that Dionysus of \"enthusiasm\" already belonged; it was to the Athenians of the town, to urbane young men, sitting together at the banquet, that those expressions of a sudden eloquence came, of the loosened utterance and finer speech, its colour and imagery. Dionysus, then, has entered Athens, to become urbane like them; to walk along the marble streets in frequent procession, in the persons of noble youths, like those who at the Oschophoria bore the branches of the vine from his temple, to the temple of Athene of the Parasol, or of beautiful slaves; to contribute through the arts to the adornment of life, yet perhaps also in part to weaken it, relaxing ancient austerity. Gradually, his rough country feasts will be outdone by the feasts of the town; and as comedy arose out of those, so these will give rise to tragedy. For his entrance upon this new stage of his career, his coming into the town, is from the [40] first tinged with melancholy, as if in entering the town he had put off his country peace. The other Olympians are above sorrow. Dionysus, like a strenuous mortal hero, like Hercules or Perseus, has his alternations of joy and sorrow, of struggle and hard-won triumph. It is out of the sorrows of Dionysus, then,--of Dionysus in winter--that all Greek tragedy grows; out of the song of the sorrows of Dionysus, sung at his winter feast by the chorus of satyrs, singers clad in goat-skins, in memory of his rural life, one and another of whom, from time to time, steps out of the company to emphasise and develope this or that circumstance of the story; and so the song becomes dramatic. He will soon forget that early country life, or remember it but as the dreamy background of his later existence. He will become, as always in later art and poetry, of dazzling whiteness; no longer dark with the air and sun, but like one eskiatrofêkôs+--brought up under the shade of Eastern porticoes or pavilions, or in the light that has only reached him softened through the texture of green leaves; honey-pale, like the delicate people of the city, like the flesh of women, as those old vase-painters conceive of it, who leave their hands and faces untouched with the pencil on the white clay. The ruddy god of the vineyard, stained with wine-lees, or coarser colour, will hardly recognise his double, in the white, graceful, mournful figure, weeping, chastened, lifting up his arms in yearning+ [41] affection towards his late-found mother, as we see him on a famous Etruscan mirror. Only, in thinking of this early tragedy, of these town- feasts, and of the entrance of Dionysus into Athens, you must suppose, not the later Athens which is oftenest in our thoughts, the Athens of Pericles and Pheidias; but that little earlier Athens of Peisistratus, which the Persians destroyed, which some of us perhaps would rather have seen, in its early simplicity, than the greater one; when the old image of the god, carved probably out of the stock of an enormous vine, had just come from the village of Eleutherae to his first temple in the Lenaeum--the quarter of the winepresses, near the Limnae--the marshy place, which in Athens represents the cave of Nysa; its little buildings on the hill-top, still with steep rocky ways, crowding round the ancient temple of Erechtheus and the grave of Cecrops, with the old miraculous olive-tree still growing there, and the old snake of Athene Polias still alive somewhere in the temple court. The artists of the Italian Renaissance have treated Dionysus many times, and with great effect, but always in his joy, as an embodiment of that glory of nature to which the Renaissance was a return. But in an early engraving of Mocetto there is for once a Dionysus treated differently. The cold light of the background displays a barren hill, the bridge and towers of [42] an Italian town, and quiet water. In the foreground, at the root of a vine, Dionysus is sitting, in a posture of statuesque weariness; the leaves of the vine are grandly drawn, and wreathing heavily round the head of the god, suggest the notion of his incorporation into it. The right hand, holding a great vessel languidly and indifferently, lets the stream of wine flow along the earth; while the left supports the forehead, shadowing heavily a face, comely, but full of an expression of painful brooding. One knows not how far one may really be from the mind of the old Italian engraver, in gathering from his design this impression of a melancholy and sorrowing Dionysus. But modern motives are clearer; and in a Bacchus by a young Hebrew painter, in the exhibition of the Royal Academy of 1868, there was a complete and very fascinating realisation of such a motive; the god of the bitterness of wine, \"of things too sweet\"; the sea-water of the Lesbian grape become somewhat brackish in the cup. Touched by the sentiment of this subtler, melancholy Dionysus, we may ask whether anything similar in feeling is to be actually found in the range of Greek ideas;--had some antitype of this fascinating figure any place in Greek religion? Yes; in a certain darker side of the double god of nature, obscured behind the brighter episodes of Thebes and Naxos, but never quite forgotten, something corresponding to this deeper, more refined idea, [43] really existed--the conception of Dionysus Zagreus; an image, which has left, indeed, but little effect in Greek art and poetry, which criticism has to put patiently together, out of late, scattered hints in various writers; but which is yet discernible, clearly enough to show that it really visited certain Greek minds here and there; and discernible, not as a late after- thought, but as a tradition really primitive, and harmonious with the original motive of the idea of Dionysus. In its potential, though unrealised scope, it is perhaps the subtlest dream in Greek religious poetry, and is, at least, part of the complete physiognomy of Dionysus, as it actually reveals itself to the modern student, after a complete survey. The whole compass of the idea of Dionysus, a dual god of both summer and winter, became ultimately, as we saw, almost identical with that of Demeter. The Phrygians believed that the god slept in winter and awoke in summer, and celebrated his waking and sleeping; or that he was bound and imprisoned in winter, and unbound in spring. We saw how, in Elis and at Argos, the women called him out of the sea, with the singing of hymns, in early spring; and a beautiful ceremony in the temple at Delphi, which, as we know, he shares with Apollo, described by Plutarch, represents his mystical resurrection. Yearly, about the time of the shortest day, just as the light begins to increase, [44] and while hope is still tremulously strung, the priestesses of Dionysus were wont to assemble with many lights at his shrine, and there, with songs and dances, awoke the new-born child after his wintry sleep, waving in a sacred cradle, like the great basket used for winnowing corn, a symbolical image, or perhaps a real infant. He is twofold then--a Döppelganger; like Persephone, he belongs to two worlds, and has much in common with her, and a full share of those dark possibilities which, even apart from the story of the rape, belong to her. He is a Chthonian god, and, like all the children of the earth, has an element of sadness; like Hades himself, he is hollow and devouring, an eater of man's flesh--sarcophagus--the grave which consumed unaware the ivory-white shoulder of Pelops. And you have no sooner caught a glimpse of this image, than a certain perceptible shadow comes creeping over the whole story; for, in effect, we have seen glimpses of the sorrowing Dionysus, all along. Part of the interest of the Theban legend of his birth is that he comes of the marriage of a god with a mortal woman; and from the first, like merely mortal heroes, he falls within the sphere of human chances. At first, indeed, the melancholy settles round the person of his mother, dead in childbirth, and ignorant of the glory of her son; in shame, according to Euripides; punished, as her own sisters allege, for impiety. The death of Semele [45] is a sort of ideal or type of this peculiar claim on human pity, as the descent of Persephone into Hades, of all human pity over the early death of women. Accordingly, his triumph being now consummated, he descends into Hades, through the unfathomable Alcyonian lake, according to the most central version of the legend, to bring her up from thence; and that Hermes, the shadowy conductor of souls, is constantly associated with Dionysus, in the story of his early life, is not without significance in this connexion. As in Delphi the winter months were sacred to him, so in Athens his feasts all fall within the four months on this and the other side of the shortest day; as Persephone spends those four months--a third part of the year--in Hades. Son or brother of Persephone he actually becomes at last, in confused, half- developed tradition; and even has his place, with his dark sister, in the Eleusinian mysteries, as Iacchus; where, on the sixth day of the feast, in the great procession from Athens to Eleusis, we may still realise his image, moving up and down above the heads of the vast multitude, as he goes, beside \"the two,\" to the temple of Demeter, amid the light of torches at noonday. But it was among the mountains of Thrace that this gloomier element in the being of Dionysus had taken the strongest hold. As in the sunny villages of Attica the cheerful elements of his religion had been developed, so, in those [46] wilder northern regions, people continued to brood over its darker side, and hence a current of gloomy legend descended into Greece. The subject of the Bacchanals of Euripides is the infatuated opposition of Pentheus, king of Thebes, to Dionysus and his religion; his cruelty to the god, whom he shuts up in prison, and who appears on the stage with his delicate limbs cruelly bound, but who is finally triumphant; Pentheus, the man of grief, being torn to pieces by his own mother, in the judicial madness sent upon her by the god. In this play, Euripides has only taken one of many versions of the same story, in all of which Dionysus is victorious, his enemy being torn to pieces by the sacred women, or by wild horses, or dogs, or the fangs of cold; or the maenad Ambrosia, whom he is supposed to pursue for purposes of lust, suddenly becomes a vine, and binds him down to the earth inextricably, in her serpentine coils. In all these instances, then, Dionysus punishes his enemies by repaying them in kind. But a deeper vein of poetry pauses at the sorrow, and in the conflict does not too soon anticipate the final triumph. It is Dionysus himself who exhausts these sufferings. Hence, in many forms--reflexes of all the various phases of his wintry existence--the image of Dionysus Zagreus, the Hunter--of Dionysus in winter--storming wildly on the dark Thracian hills, from which, like Ares and Boreas, he originally descends into [47] Greece; the thought of the hunter concentrating into itself all men's forebodings over the departure of the year at its richest, and the death of all sweet things in the long-continued cold, when the sick and the old and little children, gazing out morning after morning on the dun sky, can hardly believe in the return any more of a bright day. Or he is connected with the fears, the dangers and hardships of the hunter himself, lost or slain sometimes, far from home, in the dense woods of the mountains, as he seeks his meat so ardently; becoming, in his chase, almost akin to the wild beasts--to the wolf, who comes before us in the name of Lycurgus, one of his bitterest enemies--and a phase, therefore, of his own personality, in the true intention of the myth. This transformation, this image of the beautiful soft creature become an enemy of human kind, putting off himself in his madness, wronged by his own fierce hunger and thirst, and haunting, with terrible sounds, the high Thracian farms, is the most tragic note of the whole picture, and links him on to one of the gloomiest creations of later romance, the werewolf, the belief in which still lingers in Greece, as in France, where it seems to become incorporate in the darkest of all romantic histories, that of Gilles de Retz. And now we see why the tradition of human sacrifice lingered on in Greece, in connexion with Dionysus, as a thing of actual detail, and [48] not remote, so that Dionysius of Halicarnassus counts it among the horrors of Greek religion. That the sacred women of Dionysus ate, in mystical ceremony, raw flesh, and drank blood, is a fact often mentioned, and commemorates, as it seems, the actual sacrifice of a fair boy deliberately torn to pieces, fading at last into a symbolical offering. At Delphi, the wolf was preserved for him, on the principle by which Venus loves the dove, and Hera peacocks; and there were places in which, after the sacrifice of a kid to him, a curious mimic pursuit of the priest who had offered it represented the still surviving horror of one who had thrown a child to the wolves. The three daughters of Minyas devote themselves to his worship; they cast lots, and one of them offers her own tender infant to be torn by the three, like a roe; then the other women pursue them, and they are turned into bats, or moths, or other creatures of the night. And fable is endorsed by history; Plutarch telling us how, before the battle of Salamis, with the assent of Themistocles, three Persian captive youths were offered to Dionysus the Devourer. As, then, some embodied their fears of winter in Persephone, others embodied them in Dionysus, a devouring god, whose sinister side (as the best wine itself has its treacheries) is illustrated in the dark and shameful secret society described by Livy, in which his worship ended at Rome, afterwards abolished by solemn act of the senate. [49] He becomes a new Aidoneus, a hunter of men's souls; like him, to be appeased only by costly sacrifices. And then, Dionysus recovering from his mid-winter madness, how intensely these people conceive the spring! It is that triumphant Dionysus, cured of his great malady, and sane in the clear light of the longer days, whom Euripides in the Bacchanals sets before us, as still, essentially, the Hunter, Zagreus; though he keeps the red streams and torn flesh away from the delicate body of the god, in his long vesture of white and gold, and fragrant with Eastern odours. Of this I hope to speak in another paper; let me conclude this by one phase more of religious custom. If Dionysus, like Persephone, has his gloomy side, like her he has also a peculiar message for a certain number of refined minds, seeking, in the later days of Greek religion, such modifications of the old legend as may minister to ethical culture, to the perfecting of the moral nature. A type of second birth, from first to last, he opens, in his series of annual changes, for minds on the look-out for it, the hope of a possible analogy, between the resurrection of nature, and something else, as yet unrealised, reserved for human souls; and the beautiful, weeping creature, vexed by the wind, suffering, torn to pieces, and rejuvenescent again at last, like a tender shoot of living green out of the hardness and stony darkness+ [50] of the earth, becomes an emblem or ideal of chastening and purification, and of final victory through suffering. It is the finer, mystical sentiment of the few, detached from the coarser and more material religion of the many, and accompanying it, through the course of its history, as its ethereal, less palpable, life-giving soul, and, as always happens, seeking the quiet, and not too anxious to make itself felt by others. With some unfixed, though real, place in the general scheme of Greek religion, this phase of the worship of Dionysus had its special development in the Orphic literature and mysteries. Obscure as are those followers of the mystical Orpheus, we yet certainly see them, moving, and playing their part, in the later ages of Greek religion. Old friends with new faces, though they had, as Plato witnesses, their less worthy aspect, in certain appeals to vulgar, superstitious fears, they seem to have been not without the charm of a real and inward religious beauty, with their neologies, their new readings of old legends, their sense of mystical second meanings, as they refined upon themes grown too familiar, and linked, in a sophisticated age, the new to the old. In this respect, we may perhaps liken them to the mendicant orders in the Middle Ages, with their florid, romantic theology, beyond the bounds of orthodox tradition, giving so much new matter to art and poetry. They are a picturesque addition, also, to the exterior of Greek life, with [51] their white dresses, their dirges, their fastings and ecstasies, their outward asceticism and material purifications. And the central object of their worship comes before us as a tortured, persecuted, slain god--the suffering Dionysus--of whose legend they have their own special and esoteric version. That version, embodied in a supposed Orphic poem, The Occultation of Dionysus, is represented only by the details that have passed from it into the almost endless Dionysiaca of Nonnus, a writer of the fourth century; and the imagery has to be put back into the shrine, bit by bit, and finally incomplete. Its central point is the picture of the rending to pieces of a divine child, of whom a tradition, scanty indeed, but harmonious in its variations, had long maintained itself. It was in memory of it, that those who were initiated into the Orphic mysteries tasted of the raw flesh of the sacrifice, and thereafter ate flesh no more; and it connected itself with that strange object in the Delphic shrine, the grave of Dionysus. Son, first, of Zeus, and of Persephone whom Zeus woos, in the form of a serpent--the white, golden-haired child, the best-beloved of his father, and destined by him to be the ruler of the world, grows up in secret. But one day, Zeus, departing on a journey in his great fondness for the child, delivered to him his crown and staff, and so left him--shut in a strong tower. Then it came to pass that the jealous Here sent [52] out the Titans against him. They approached the crowned child, and with many sorts of playthings enticed him away, to have him in their power, and then miserably slew him-- hacking his body to pieces, as the wind tears the vine, with the axe Pelekus, which, like the swords of Roland and Arthur, has its proper name. The fragments of the body they boiled in a great cauldron, and made an impious banquet upon them, afterwards carrying the bones to Apollo, whose rival the young child should have been, thinking to do him service. But Apollo, in great pity for this his youngest brother, laid the bones in a grave, within his own holy place. Meanwhile, Here, full of her vengeance, brings to Zeus the heart of the child, which she had snatched, still beating, from the hands of the Titans. But Zeus delivered the heart to Semele; and the soul of the child remaining awhile in Hades, where Demeter made for it new flesh, was thereafter born of Semele--a second Zagreus--the younger, or Theban Dionysus.

In such a picture there must necessarily be a certain artificiality; things near and far, matter of varying degrees of certainty, fact and surmise, being reflected and concentrated, for its production, as if on the surface of a mirror. Such concrete character, however, Greek poet or sculptor, from time to time, impressed on the vague world of popular belief and usage around him; and in the Bacchanals of Euripides we have an example of the figurative or imaginative power of poetry, selecting and combining, at will, from that mixed and floating mass, weaving the many-coloured threads together, blending the various phases of legend--all the light and shade of the [54] subject--into a shape, substantial and firmly set, through which a mere fluctuating tradition might retain a permanent place in men's imaginations. Here, in what Euripides really says, in what we actually see on the stage, as we read his play, we are dealing with a single real object, not with uncertain effects of many half-fancied objects. Let me leave you for a time almost wholly in his hands, while you look very closely at his work, so as to discriminate its outlines clearly. This tragedy of the Bacchanals--a sort of masque or morality, as we say--a monument as central for the legend of Dionysus as the Homeric hymn for that of Demeter, is unique in Greek literature, and has also a singular interest in the life of Euripides himself. He is writing in old age (the piece was not played till after his death) not at Athens, nor for a polished Attic audience, but for a wilder and less temperately cultivated sort of people, at the court of Archelaus, in Macedonia. Writing in old age, he is in that subdued mood, a mood not necessarily sordid, in which (the shudder at the nearer approach of the unknown world coming over him more frequently than of old) accustomed ideas, conformable to a sort of common sense regarding the unseen, oftentimes regain what they may have lost, in a man's allegiance. It is a sort of madness, he begins to think, to differ from the received opinions thereon. Not that he is insincere or ironical, but that he tends, in the [55] sum of probabilities, to dwell on their more peaceful side; to sit quiet, for the short remaining time, in the reflexion of the more cheerfully lighted side of things; and what is accustomed--what holds of familiar usage-- comes to seem the whole essence of wisdom, on all subjects; and the well-known delineation of the vague country, in Homer or Hesiod, one's best attainable mental outfit, for the journey thither. With this sort of quiet wisdom the whole play is penetrated. Euripides has said, or seemed to say, many things concerning Greek religion, at variance with received opinion; and now, in the end of life, he desires to make his peace--what shall at any rate be peace with men. He is in the mood for acquiescence, or even for a palinode; and this takes the direction, partly of mere submission to, partly of a refining upon, the authorised religious tradition: he calmly sophisticates this or that element of it which had seemed grotesque; and has, like any modern writer, a theory how myths were made, and how in lapse of time their first signification gets to be obscured among mortals; and what he submits to, that he will also adorn fondly, by his genius for words. And that very neighbourhood afforded him his opportunity. It was in the neighbourhood of Pella, the Macedonian capital, that the worship of Dionysus, the newest of the gods, prevailed in its most extravagant form--the [56] Thiasus, or wild, nocturnal procession of Bacchic women, retired to the woods and hills for that purpose, with its accompaniments of music, and lights, and dancing. Rational and moderate Athenians, as we may gather from some admissions of Euripides himself, somewhat despised all that; while those who were more fanatical forsook the home celebrations, and went on pilgrimage from Attica to Cithaeron or Delphi. But at Pella persons of high birth took part in the exercise, and at a later period we read in Plutarch how Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great, was devoted to this enthusiastic worship. Although in one of Botticelli's pictures the angels dance very sweetly, and may represent many circumstances actually recorded in the Hebrew scriptures, yet we hardly understand the dance as a religious ceremony; the bare mention of it sets us thinking on some fundamental differences between the pagan religions and our own. It is to such ecstasies, however, that all nature-worship seems to tend; that giddy, intoxicating sense of spring--that tingling in the veins, sympathetic with the yearning life of the earth, having, apparently, in all times and places, prompted some mode of wild dancing. Coleridge, in one of his fantastic speculations, refining on the German word for enthusiasm-- Schwärmerei, swarming, as he says, \"like the swarming of bees together\"--has explained how the sympathies of mere numbers, as such, the random catching on [57] fire of one here and another there, when people are collected together, generates as if by mere contact, some new and rapturous spirit, not traceable in the individual units of a multitude. Such swarming was the essence of that strange dance of the Bacchic women: literally like winged things, they follow, with motives, we may suppose, never quite made clear even to themselves, their new, strange, romantic god. Himself a woman-like god,--it was on women and feminine souls that his power mainly fell. At Elis, it was the women who had their own little song with which at spring-time they professed to call him from the sea: at Brasiae they had their own temple where none but women might enter; and so the Thiasus, also, is almost exclusively formed of women--of those who experience most directly the influence of things which touch thought through the senses--the presence of night, the expectation of morning, the nearness of wild, unsophisticated, natural things--the echoes, the coolness, the noise of frightened creatures as they climbed through the darkness, the sunrise seen from the hill-tops, the disillusion, the bitterness of satiety, the deep slumber which comes with the morning. Athenians visiting the Macedonian capital would hear, and from time to time actually see, something of a religious custom, in which the habit of an earlier world might seem to survive. As they saw the lights flitting over the mountains, [58] and heard the wild, sharp cries of the women, there was presented, as a singular fact in the more prosaic actual life of a later time, an enthusiasm otherwise relegated to the wonderland of a distant past, in which a supposed primitive harmony and understanding between man and nature renewed itself. Later sisters of Centaur and Amazon, the Maenads, as they beat the earth in strange sympathy with its waking up from sleep, or as, in the description of the Messenger, in the play of Euripides, they lie sleeping in the glen, revealed among the morning mists, were themselves indeed as remnants--flecks left here and there and not yet quite evaporated under the hard light of a later and commoner day--of a certain cloud-world which had once covered all things with a veil of mystery. Whether or not, in what was often probably coarse as well as extravagant, there may have lurked some finer vein of ethical symbolism, such as Euripides hints at--the soberer influence, in the Thiasus, of keen air and animal expansion, certainly, for art, and a poetry delighting in colour and form, it was a custom rich in suggestion. The imitative arts would draw from it altogether new motives of freedom and energy, of freshness in old forms. It is from this fantastic scene that the beautiful wind-touched draperies, the rhythm, the heads suddenly thrown back, of many a Pompeian wall- painting and sarcophagus-frieze are originally derived; and that melting languor, that perfectly [59] composed lassitude of the fallen Maenad, became a fixed type in the school of grace, the school of Praxiteles. The circumstances of the place thus combining with his peculiar motive, Euripides writes the Bacchanals. It is this extravagant phase of religion, and the latest-born of the gods, which as an amende honorable to the once slighted traditions of Greek belief, he undertakes to interpret to an audience composed of people who, like Scyles, the Hellenising king of Scythia, feel the attraction of Greek religion and Greek usage, but on their quainter side, and partly relish that extravagance. Subject and audience alike stimulate the romantic temper, and the tragedy of the Bacchanals, with its innovations in metre and diction, expressly noted as foreign or barbarous--all the charm and grace of the clear-pitched singing of the chorus, notwithstanding--with its subtleties and sophistications, its grotesques, mingled with and heightening a real shudder at the horror of the theme, and a peculiarly fine and human pathos, is almost wholly without the reassuring calm, generally characteristic of the endings of Greek tragedy: is itself excited, troubled, disturbing--a spotted or dappled thing, like the oddly dappled fawn- skins of its own masquerade, so aptly expressive of the shifty, twofold, rapidly-doubling genius of the divine, wild creature himself. Let us listen and watch the strange masks coming and going, for a while, [60] as far as may be as we should do with a modern play. What are its charms? What is still alive, impressive, and really poetical for us, in the dim old Greek play? The scene is laid at Thebes, where the memory of Semele, the mother of Dionysus, is still under a cloud. Her own sisters, sinning against natural affection, pitiless over her pathetic death and finding in it only a judgment upon the impiety with which, having shamed herself with some mortal lover, she had thrown the blame of her sin upon Zeus, have, so far, triumphed over her. The true and glorious version of her story lives only in the subdued memory of the two aged men, Teiresias the prophet, and her father Cadmus, apt now to let things go loosely by, who has delegated his royal power to Pentheus, the son of one of those sisters--a hot-headed and impious youth. So things had passed at Thebes; and now a strange circumstance has happened. An odd sickness has fallen upon the women: Dionysus has sent the sting of his enthusiasm upon them, and has pushed it to a sort of madness, a madness which imitates the true Thiasus. Forced to have the form without the profit of his worship, the whole female population, leaving distaff and spindle, and headed by the three princesses, have deserted the town, and are lying encamped on the bare rocks, or under the pines, among the solitudes of Cithaeron. And it is just at this point that the divine child, [61] supposed to have perished at his mother's side in the flames, returns to his birthplace, grown to manhood. Dionysus himself speaks the prologue. He is on a journey through the world to found a new religion; and the first motive of this new religion is the vindication of the memory of his mother. In explaining this design, Euripides, who seeks always for pathetic effect, tells in few words, touching because simple, the story of Semele--here, and again still more intensely in the chorus which follows--the merely human sentiment of maternity being not forgotten, even amid the thought of the divine embraces of her fiery bed-fellow. It is out of tenderness for her that the son's divinity is to be revealed. A yearning affection, the affection with which we see him lifting up his arms about her, satisfied at last, on an old Etruscan metal mirror, has led him from place to place: everywhere he has had his dances and established his worship; and everywhere his presence has been her justification. First of all the towns in Greece he comes to Thebes, the scene of her sorrows: he is standing beside the sacred waters of Dirce and Ismenus: the holy place is in sight: he hears the Greek speech, and sees at last the ruins of the place of her lying-in, at once his own birth-chamber and his mother's tomb. His image, as it detaches itself little by little from the episodes of the play, and is further characterised by the [62] songs of the chorus, has a singular completeness of symbolical effect. The incidents of a fully developed human personality are superinduced on the mystical and abstract essence of that fiery spirit in the flowing veins of the earth--the aroma of the green world is retained in the fair human body, set forth in all sorts of finer ethical lights and shades--with a wonderful kind of subtlety. In the course of his long progress from land to land, the gold, the flowers, the incense of the East, have attached themselves deeply to him: their effect and expression rest now upon his flesh like the gleaming of that old ambrosial ointment of which Homer speaks as resting ever on the persons of the gods, and cling to his clothing--the mitre binding his perfumed yellow hair--the long tunic down to the white feet, somewhat womanly, and the fawn-skin, with its rich spots, wrapped about the shoulders. As the door opens to admit him, the scented air of the vineyards (for the vine-blossom has an exquisite perfume) blows through; while the convolvulus on his mystic rod represents all wreathing flowery things whatever, with or without fruit, as in America all such plants are still called vines. \"Sweet upon the mountains,\" the excitement of which he loves so deeply and to which he constantly invites his followers--\"sweet upon the mountains,\" and profoundly amorous, his presence embodies all the voluptuous abundance of Asia, its beating [63] sun, its \"fair-towered cities, full of inhabitants,\" which the chorus describe in their luscious vocabulary, with the rich Eastern names--Lydia, Persia, Arabia Felix: he is a sorcerer or an enchanter, the tyrant Pentheus thinks: the springs of water, the flowing of honey and milk and wine, are his miracles, wrought in person. We shall see presently how, writing for that northern audience, Euripides crosses the Theban with the gloomier Thracian legend, and lets the darker stain show through. Yet, from the first, amid all this floweriness, a touch or trace of that gloom is discernible. The fawn-skin, composed now so daintily over the shoulders, may be worn with the whole coat of the animal made up, the hoofs gilded and tied together over the right shoulder, to leave the right arm disengaged to strike, its head clothing the human head within, as Alexander, on some of his coins, looks out from the elephant's scalp, and Hercules out of the jaws of a lion, on the coins of Camarina. Those diminutive golden horns attached to the forehead, represent not fecundity merely, nor merely the crisp tossing of the waves of streams, but horns of offence. And our fingers must beware of the thyrsus, tossed about so wantonly by himself and his chorus. The pine-cone at its top does but cover a spear-point; and the thing is a weapon--the sharp spear of the hunter Zagreus--though hidden now by the fresh leaves, and that button of pine-cone (useful also to dip in [64] wine, to check the sweetness) which he has plucked down, coming through the forest, at peace for a while this spring morning. And the chorus emphasise this character, their songs weaving for the whole piece, in words more effective than any painted scenery, a certain congruous background which heightens all; the intimate sense of mountains and mountain things being in this way maintained throughout, and concentrated on the central figure. \"He is sweet among the mountains,\" they say, \"when he drops down upon the plain, out of his mystic musings\"--and we may think we see the green festoons of the vine dropping quickly, from foot-place to foot-place, down the broken hill-side in spring, when like the Bacchanals, all who can, wander out of the town to enjoy the earliest heats. \"Let us go out into the fields,\" we say; a strange madness seems to lurk among the flowers, ready to lay hold on us also; autika ga pasa choreusei+--soon the whole earth will dance and sing. Dionysus is especially a woman's deity, and he comes from the east conducted by a chorus of gracious Lydian women, his true sisters-- Bassarids, clad like himself in the long tunic, or bassara. They move and speak to the music of clangorous metallic instruments, cymbals and tambourines, relieved by the clearer notes of the pipe; and there is a strange variety of almost imitative sounds for such music, in their very [65] words. The Homeric hymn to Demeter precedes the art of sculpture, but is rich in suggestions for it; here, on the contrary, in the first chorus of the Bacchanals, as elsewhere in the play, we feel that the poetry of Euripides is probably borrowing something from art; that in these choruses, with their repetitions and refrains, he is reproducing perhaps the spirit of some sculptured relief which, like Luca della Robbia's celebrated work for the organ-loft of the cathedral of Florence, worked by various subtleties of line, not in the lips and eyes only, but in the drapery and hands also, to a strange reality of impression of musical effect on visible things. They beat their drums before the palace; and then a humourous little scene, a reflex of the old Dionysiac comedy--of that laughter which was an essential element of the earliest worship of Dionysus--follows the first chorus. The old blind prophet Teiresias, and the aged king Cadmus, always secretly true to him, have agreed to celebrate the Thiasus, and accept his divinity openly. The youthful god has nowhere said decisively that he will have none but young men in his sacred dance. But for that purpose they must put on the long tunic, and that spotted skin which only rustics wear, and assume the thyrsus and ivy-crown. Teiresias arrives and is seen knocking at the doors. And then, just as in the medieval mystery, comes the [66] inevitable grotesque, not unwelcome to our poet, who is wont in his plays, perhaps not altogether consciously, to intensify by its relief both the pity and the terror of his conceptions. At the summons of Teiresias, Cadmus appears, already arrayed like him in the appointed ornaments, in all their odd contrast with the infirmity and staidness of old age. Even in old men's veins the spring leaps again, and they are more than ready to begin dancing. But they are shy of the untried dress, and one of them is blind--poi dei choreuein; poi kathistanai poda; kai krata seisai polion;+ and then the difficulty of the way! the long, steep journey to the glens! may pilgrims boil their peas? might they proceed to the place in carriages? At last, while the audience laugh more or less delicately at their aged fumblings, in some co-operative manner, the eyes of the one combining with the hands of the other, the pair are about to set forth. Here Pentheus is seen approaching the palace in extreme haste. He has been absent from home, and returning, has just heard of the state of things at Thebes--the strange malady of the women, the dancings, the arrival of the mysterious stranger: he finds all the women departed from the town, and sees Cadmus and Teiresias in masque. Like the exaggerated diabolical figures in some of the religious plays and imageries of the Middle Age, he is an impersonation of stupid impiety, one of those whom the gods willing to [67] destroy first infatuate. Alternating between glib unwisdom and coarse mockery, between violence and a pretence of moral austerity, he understands only the sorriest motives; thinks the whole thing feigned, and fancies the stranger, so effeminate, so attractive of women with whom he remains day and night, but a poor sensual creature, and the real motive of the Bacchic women the indulgence of their lust; his ridiculous old grandfather he is ready to renounce, and accuses Teiresias of having in view only some fresh source of professional profit to himself in connexion with some new-fangled oracle; his petty spite avenges itself on the prophet by an order to root up the sacred chair, where he sits to watch the birds for divination, and disturb the order of his sacred place; and even from the moment of his entrance the mark of his doom seems already set upon him, in an impotent trembling which others notice in him. Those of the women who still loitered, he has already caused to be shut up in the common prison; the others, with Ino, Autonoe, and his own mother, Agave, he will hunt out of the glens; while the stranger is threatened with various cruel forms of death. But Teiresias and Cadmus stay to reason with him, and induce him to abide wisely with them; the prophet fittingly becomes the interpreter of Dionysus, and explains the true nature of the visitor; his divinity, the completion or counterpart of that of Demeter; his gift of prophecy; [68] all the soothing influences he brings with him; above all, his gift of the medicine of sleep to weary mortals. But the reason of Pentheus is already sickening, and the judicial madness gathering over it. Teiresias and Cadmus can but \"go pray.\" So again, not without the laughter of the audience, supporting each other a little grotesquely against a fall, they get away at last. And then, again, as in those quaintly carved and coloured imageries of the Middle Age--the martyrdom of the youthful Saint Firmin, for instance, round the choir at Amiens--comes the full contrast, with a quite medieval simplicity and directness, between the insolence of the tyrant, now at last in sight of his prey, and the outraged beauty of the youthful god, meek, surrounded by his enemies, like some fair wild creature in the snare of the hunter. Dionysus has been taken prisoner; he is led on to the stage, with his hands bound, but still holding the thyrsus. Unresisting he had submitted himself to his captors; his colour had not changed; with a smile he had bidden them do their will, so that even they are touched with awe, and are almost ready to admit his divinity. Marvellously white and red, he stands there; and now, unwilling to be revealed to the unworthy, and requiring a fitness in the receiver, he represents himself, in answer to the inquiries of Pentheus, not as Dionysus, but simply as the god's prophet, [69] in full trust in whom he desires to hear his sentence. Then the long hair falls to the ground under the shears; the mystic wand is torn from his hand, and he is led away to be tied up, like some dangerous wild animal, in a dark place near the king's stables. Up to this point in the play, there has been a noticeable ambiguity as to the person of Dionysus, the main figure of the piece; he is in part Dionysus, indeed; but in part, only his messenger, or minister preparing his way; a certain harshness of effect in the actual appearance of a god upon the stage being in this way relieved, or made easy, as by a gradual revelation in two steps. To Pentheus, in his invincible ignorance, his essence remains to the last unrevealed, and even the women of the chorus seem to understand in him, so far, only the forerunner of their real leader. As he goes away bound, therefore, they too, threatened also in their turn with slavery, invoke his greater original to appear and deliver them. In pathetic cries they reproach Thebes for rejecting them--ti m' anainei, ti me pheugeis;+ yet they foretell his future greatness; a new Orpheus, he will more than renew that old miraculous reign over animals and plants. Their song is full of suggestions of wood and river. It is as if, for a moment, Dionysus became the suffering vine again; and the rustle of the leaves and water come through their words to refresh it. The [70] fountain of Dirce still haunted by the virgins of Thebes, where the infant god was cooled and washed from the flecks of his fiery birth, becomes typical of the coolness of all springs, and is made, by a really poetic licence, the daughter of the distant Achelous--the earliest born, the father in myth, of all Greek rivers. A giddy sonorous scene of portents and surprises follows--a distant, exaggerated, dramatic reflex of that old thundering tumult of the festival in the vineyard--in which Dionysus reappears, miraculously set free from his bonds. First, in answer to the deep-toned invocation of the chorus, a great voice is heard from within, proclaiming him to be the son of Semele and Zeus. Then, amid the short, broken, rapturous cries of the women of the chorus, proclaiming him master, the noise of an earthquake passes slowly; the pillars of the palace are seen waving to and fro; while the strange, memorial fire from the tomb of Semele blazes up and envelopes the whole building. The terrified women fling themselves on the ground; and then, at last, as the place is shaken open, Dionysus is seen stepping out from among the tottering masses of the mimic palace, bidding them arise and fear not. But just here comes a long pause in the action of the play, in which we must listen to a messenger newly arrived from the glens, to tell us what he has seen there, among the Maenads. The singular, somewhat sinister beauty of this speech, and a [71] similar one subsequent--a fair description of morning on the mountain-tops, with the Bacchic women sleeping, which turns suddenly to a hard, coarse picture of animals cruelly rent--is one of the special curiosities which distinguish this play; and, as it is wholly narrative, I shall give it in English prose, abbreviating, here and there, some details which seem to have but a metrical value:-- \"I was driving my herd of cattle to the summit of the scaur to feed, what time the sun sent forth his earliest beams to warm the earth. And lo! three companies of women, and at the head of one of them Autonoe, thy mother Agave at the head of the second, and Ino at the head of the third. And they all slept, with limbs relaxed, leaned against the low boughs of the pines, or with head thrown heedlessly among the oak-leaves strewn upon the ground--all in the sleep of temperance, not, as thou saidst, pursuing Cypris through the solitudes of the forest, drunken with wine, amid the low rustling of the lotus-pipe. \"And thy mother, when she heard the lowing of the kine, stood up in the midst of them, and cried to them to shake off sleep. And they, casting slumber from their eyes, started upright, a marvel of beauty and order, young and old and maidens yet unmarried. And first, they let fall their hair upon their shoulders; and those [72] whose cinctures were unbound re-composed the spotted fawn-skins, knotting them about with snakes, which rose and licked them on the chin. Some, lately mothers, who with breasts still swelling had left their babes behind, nursed in their arms antelopes, or wild whelps of wolves, and yielded them their milk to drink; and upon their heads they placed crowns of ivy or of oak, or of flowering convolvulus. Then one, taking a thyrsus-wand, struck with it upon a rock, and thereupon leapt out a fine rain of water; another let down a reed upon the earth, and a fount of wine was sent forth there; and those whose thirst was for a white stream, skimming the surface with their finger-tips, gathered from it abundance of milk; and from the ivy of the mystic wands streams of honey distilled. Verily! hadst thou seen these things, thou wouldst have worshipped whom now thou revilest. \"And we shepherds and herdsmen came together to question with each other over this matter--what strange and terrible things they do. And a certain wayfarer from the city, subtle in speech, spake to us-- 'O! dwellers upon these solemn ledges of the hills, will ye that we hunt down, and take, amid her revelries, Agave, the mother of Pentheus, according to the king's pleasure?' And he seemed to us to speak wisely; and we lay in wait among the bushes; and they, at the time appointed, began moving their wands for the Bacchic dance, [73] calling with one voice upon Bromius!--Iacchus!--the son of Zeus! and the whole mountain was moved with ecstasy together, and the wild creatures; nothing but was moved in their running. And it chanced that Agave, in her leaping, lighted near me, and I sprang from my hiding-place, willing to lay hold on her; and she groaned out, 'O! dogs of hunting, these fellows are upon our traces; but follow me! follow! with the mystic wands for weapons in your hands.' And we, by flight, hardly escaped tearing to pieces at their hands, who thereupon advanced with knifeless fingers upon the young of the kine, as they nipped the green; and then hadst thou seen one holding a bleating calf in her hands, with udder distent, straining it asunder; others tore the heifers to shreds amongst them; tossed up and down the morsels lay in sight--flank or hoof--or hung from the fir-trees, dropping churned blood. The fierce, horned bulls stumbled forward, their breasts upon the ground, dragged on by myriad hands of young women, and in a moment the inner parts were rent to morsels. So, like a flock of birds aloft in flight, they retreat upon the level lands outstretched below, which by the waters of Asopus put forth the fair-flowering crop of Theban people--Hysiae and Erythrae--below the precipice of Cithaeron.\"-- A grotesque scene follows, in which the [74] humour we noted, on seeing those two old men diffidently set forth in chaplet and fawn- skin, deepens into a profound tragic irony. Pentheus is determined to go out in arms against the Bacchanals and put them to death, when a sudden desire seizes him to witness them in their encampment upon the mountains. Dionysus, whom he still supposes to be but a prophet or messenger of the god, engages to conduct him thither; and, for greater security among the dangerous women, proposes that he shall disguise himself in female attire. As Pentheus goes within for that purpose, he lingers for a moment behind him, and in prophetic speech declares the approaching end;--the victim has fallen into the net; and he goes in to assist at the toilet, to array him in the ornaments which he will carry to Hades, destroyed by his own mother's hands. It is characteristic of Euripides--part of his fine tact and subtlety--to relieve and justify what seems tedious, or constrained, or merely terrible and grotesque, by a suddenly suggested trait of homely pathos, or a glimpse of natural beauty, or a morsel of form or colour seemingly taken directly from picture or sculpture. So here, in this fantastic scene our thoughts are changed in a moment by the singing of the chorus, and divert for a while to the dark-haired tresses of the wood; the breath of the river-side is upon us; beside it, a fawn escaped from the hunter's net is flying swiftly in [75] its joy; like it, the Maenad rushes along; and we see the little head thrown back upon the neck, in deep aspiration, to drink in the dew. Meantime, Pentheus has assumed his disguise, and comes forth tricked up with false hair and the dress of a Bacchanal; but still with some misgivings at the thought of going thus attired through the streets of Thebes, and with many laughable readjustments of the unwonted articles of clothing. And with the woman's dress, his madness is closing faster round him; just before, in the palace, terrified at the noise of the earthquake, he had drawn sword upon a mere fantastic appearance, and pierced only the empty air. Now he begins to see the sun double, and Thebes with all its towers repeated, while his conductor seems to him transformed into a wild beast; and now and then, we come upon some touches of a curious psychology, so that we might almost seem to be reading a modern poet. As if Euripides had been aware of a not unknown symptom of incipient madness (it is said) in which the patient, losing the sense of resistance, while lifting small objects imagines himself to be raising enormous weights, Pentheus, as he lifts the thyrsus, fancies he could lift Cithaeron with all the Bacchanals upon it. At all this the laughter of course will pass round the theatre; while those who really pierce into the purpose of the poet, shudder, as they see the victim thus grotesquely clad going to his doom, [76] already foreseen in the ominous chant of the chorus--and as it were his grave-clothes, in the dress which makes him ridiculous. Presently a messenger arrives to announce that Pentheus is dead, and then another curious narrative sets forth the manner of his death. Full of wild, coarse, revolting details, of course not without pathetic touches, and with the loveliness of the serving Maenads, and of their mountain solitudes--their trees and water--never quite forgotten, it describes how, venturing as a spy too near the sacred circle, Pentheus was fallen upon, like a wild beast, by the mystic huntresses and torn to pieces, his mother being the first to begin \"the sacred rites of slaughter.\" And at last Agave herself comes upon the stage, holding aloft the head of her son, fixed upon the sharp end of the thyrsus, calling upon the women of the chorus to welcome the revel of the Evian god; who, accordingly, admit her into the company, professing themselves her fellow-revellers, the Bacchanals being thus absorbed into the chorus for the rest of the play. For, indeed, all through it, the true, though partly suppressed relation of the chorus to the Bacchanals is this, that the women of the chorus, staid and temperate for the moment, following Dionysus in his alternations, are but the paler sisters of his more wild and gloomy votaries--the true followers of the mystical Dionysus--the real chorus of Zagreus; the idea that their [77] violent proceedings are the result of madness only, sent on them as a punishment for their original rejection of the god, being, as I said, when seen from the deeper motives of the myth, only a \"sophism\" of Euripides--a piece of rationalism of which he avails himself for the purpose of softening down the tradition of which he has undertaken to be the poet. Agave comes on the stage, then, blood-stained, exulting in her \"victory of tears,\" still quite visibly mad indeed, and with the outward signs of madness, and as her mind wanders, musing still on the fancy that the dead head in her hands is that of a lion she has slain among the mountains--a young lion, she avers, as she notices the down on the young man's chin, and his abundant hair--a fancy in which the chorus humour her, willing to deal gently with the poor distraught creature. Supported by them, she rejoices \"exceedingly, exceedingly,\" declaring herself \"fortunate\" in such goodly spoil; priding herself that the victim has been slain, not with iron weapons, but with her own white fingers, she summons all Thebes to come and behold. She calls for her aged father to draw near and see; and for Pentheus himself, at last, that he may mount and rivet her trophy, appropriately decorative there, between the triglyphs of the cornice below the roof, visible to all. And now, from this point onwards, Dionysus himself becomes more and more clearly discernible [78] as the hunter, a wily hunter, and man the prey he hunts for; \"Our king is a hunter,\" cry the chorus, as they unite in Agave's triumph and give their sanction to her deed. And as the Bacchanals supplement the chorus, and must be added to it to make the conception of it complete; so in the conception of Dionysus also a certain transference, or substitution, must be made-- much of the horror and sorrow of Agave, of Pentheus, of the whole tragic situation, must be transferred to him, if we wish to realise in the older, profounder, and more complete sense of his nature, that mystical being of Greek tradition to whom all these experiences--his madness, the chase, his imprisonment and death, his peace again-- really belong; and to discern which, through Euripides' peculiar treatment of his subject, is part of the curious interest of this play. Through the sophism of Euripides! For that, again, is the really descriptive word, with which Euripides, a lover of sophisms, as Aristophanes knows, himself supplies us. Well;--this softened version of the Bacchic madness is a sophism of Euripides; and Dionysus Omophagus--the eater of raw flesh, must be added to the golden image of Dionysus Meilichius--the honey-sweet, if the old tradition in its completeness is to be, in spite of that sophism, our closing impression; if we are to catch, in its fulness, that deep undercurrent of horror which runs below, all through [79] this masque of spring, and realise the spectacle of that wild chase, in which Dionysus is ultimately both the hunter and the spoil. But meantime another person appears on the stage; Cadmus enters, followed by attendants bearing on a bier the torn limbs of Pentheus, which lying wildly scattered through the tangled wood, have been with difficulty collected and now decently put together and covered over. In the little that still remains before the end of the play, destiny now hurrying things rapidly forward, and strong emotions, hopes and forebodings being now closely packed, Euripides has before him an artistic problem of enormous difficulty. Perhaps this very haste and close-packing of the matter, which keeps the mind from dwelling overmuch on detail, relieves its real extravagance, and those who read it carefully will think that the pathos of Euripides has been equal to the occasion. In a few profoundly designed touches he depicts the perplexity of Cadmus, in whose house a god had become an inmate, only to destroy it--the regret of the old man for the one male child to whom that house had looked up as the pillar whereby aged people might feel secure; the piteous craziness of Agave; the unconscious irony with which she caresses the florid, youthful head of her son; the delicate breaking of the thing to her reviving intelligence, as Cadmus, though he can but wish that she might live on for ever in her visionary enjoyment, [80] prepares the way, by playing on that other horrible legend of the Theban house, the tearing of Actaeon to death--he too destroyed by a god. He gives us the sense of Agave's gradual return to reason through many glimmering doubts, till she wakes up at last to find the real face turned up towards the mother and murderess; the quite naturally spontaneous sorrow of the mother, ending with her confession, down to her last sigh, and the final breaking up of the house of Cadmus; with a result so genuine, heartfelt, and dignified withal in its expression of a strange ineffable woe, that a fragment of it, the lamentation of Agave over her son, in which the long-pent agony at last finds vent, were, it is supposed, adopted into his paler work by an early Christian poet, and have figured since, as touches of real fire, in the Christus Patiens of Gregory Nazianzen.

THE MYTH OF DEMETER AND PERSEPHONE: I [81] No chapter in the history of human imagination is more curious than the myth of Demeter, and Kore or Persephone. Alien in some respects from the genuine traditions of Greek mythology, a relic of the earlier inhabitants of Greece, and having but a subordinate place in the religion of Homer, it yet asserted its interest, little by little, and took a complex hold on the minds of the Greeks, becoming finally the central and most popular subject of their national worship. Following its changes, we come across various phases of Greek culture, which are not without their likenesses in the modern mind. We trace it in the dim first period of instinctive popular conception; we see it connecting itself with many impressive elements of art, and poetry, and religious custom, with the picturesque superstitions of the many, and with the finer intuitions of the few; and besides this, it is in itself full of [82] interest and suggestion, to all for whom the ideas of the Greek religion have any real meaning in the modern world. And the fortune of the myth has not deserted it in later times. In the year 1780, the long-lost text of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter was discovered among the manuscripts of the imperial library at Moscow; and, in our own generation, the tact of an eminent student of Greek art, Sir Charles Newton, has restored to the world the buried treasures of the little temple and precinct of Demeter, at Cnidus, which have many claims to rank in the central order of Greek sculpture. The present essay is an attempt to select and weave together, for those who are now approaching the deeper study of Greek thought, whatever details in the development of this myth, arranged with a view rather to a total impression than to the debate of particular points, may seem likely to increase their stock of poetical impressions, and to add to this some criticisms on the expression which it has left of itself in extant art and poetry. The central expression, then, of the story of Demeter and Persephone is the Homeric hymn, to which Grote has assigned a date at least as early as six hundred years before Christ. The one survivor of a whole family of hymns on this subject, it was written, perhaps, for one of those contests which took place on the seventh day of the Eleusinian festival, and in which a bunch of [83] ears of corn was the prize; perhaps, for actual use in the mysteries themselves, by the Hierophantes, or Interpreter, who showed to the worshippers at Eleusis those sacred places to which the poem contains so many references. About the composition itself there are many difficult questions, with various surmises as to why it has remained only in this unique manuscript of the end of the fourteenth century. Portions of the text are missing, and there are probably some additions by later hands; yet most scholars have admitted that it possesses some of the true characteristics of the Homeric style, some genuine echoes of the age immediately succeeding that which produced the Iliad and the Odyssey. Listen now to a somewhat abbreviated version of it. \"I begin the song of Demeter\"--says the prize-poet, or the Interpreter, the Sacristan of the holy places--\"the song of Demeter and her daughter Persephone, whom Aidoneus carried away by the consent of Zeus, as she played, apart from her mother, with the deep- bosomed daughters of the Ocean, gathering flowers in a meadow of soft grass--roses and the crocus and fair violets and flags, and hyacinths, and, above all, the strange flower of the narcissus, which the Earth, favouring the desire of Aidoneus, brought forth for the first time, to snare the footsteps of the flower-like girl. A hundred [84] heads of blossom grew up from the roots of it, and the sky and the earth and the salt wave of the sea were glad at the scent thereof. She stretched forth her hands to take the flower; thereupon the earth opened, and the king of the great nation of the dead sprang out with his immortal horses. He seized the unwilling girl, and bore her away weeping, on his golden chariot. She uttered a shrill cry, calling upon her father Zeus; but neither man nor god heard her voice, nor even the nymphs of the meadow where she played; except Hecate only, the daughter of Persaeus, sitting, as ever, in her cave, half veiled with a shining veil, thinking delicate thoughts; she, and the Sun also, heard her. \"So long as she could still see the earth, and the sky, and the sea with the great waves moving, and the beams of the sun, and still thought to see again her mother, and the race of the ever-living gods, so long hope soothed her, in the midst of her grief. The peaks of the hills and the depths of the sea echoed her cry. And the mother heard it. A sharp pain seized her at the heart; she plucked the veil from her hair, and cast down the blue hood from her shoulders, and fled forth like a bird, seeking Persephone over dry land and sea. But neither man nor god would tell her the truth; nor did any bird come to her as a sure messenger. \"Nine days she wandered up and down upon the earth, having blazing torches in her hands; [85] and, in her great sorrow, she refused to taste of ambrosia, or of the cup of the sweet nectar, nor washed her face. But when the tenth morning came, Hecate met her, having a light in her hands. But Hecate had heard the voice only, and had seen no one, and could not tell Demeter who had borne the girl away. And Demeter said not a word, but fled away swiftly with her, having the blazing torches in her hands, till they came to the Sun, the watchman both of gods and men; and the goddess questioned him, and the Sun told her the whole story. \"Then a more terrible grief took possession of Demeter, and, in her anger against Zeus, she forsook the assembly of the gods and abode among men, for a long time veiling her beauty under a worn countenance, so that none who looked upon her knew her, until she came to the house of Celeus, who was then king of Eleusis. In her sorrow, she sat down at the wayside by the virgin's well, where the people of Eleusis come to draw water, under the shadow of an olive- tree. She seemed as an aged woman whose time of child-bearing is gone by, and from whom the gifts of Aphrodite have been withdrawn, like one of the hired servants, who nurse the children or keep house, in kings' palaces. And the daughters of Celeus, four of them, like goddesses, possessing the flower of their youth, Callidice, Cleisidice, Demo, and Callithoe the eldest of them, coming to draw water that they [86] might bear it in their brazen pitchers to their father's house, saw Demeter and knew her not. The gods are hard for men to recognise. \"They asked her kindly what she did there, alone; and Demeter answered, dissemblingly, that she was escaped from certain pirates, who had carried her from her home and meant to sell her as a slave. Then they prayed her to abide there while they returned to the palace, to ask their mother's permission to bring her home. \"Demeter bowed her head in assent; and they, having filled their shining vessels with water, bore them away, rejoicing in their beauty. They came quickly to their father's house, and told their mother what they had seen and heard. Their mother bade them return, and hire the woman for a great price; and they, like the hinds or young heifers leaping in the fields in spring, fulfilled with the pasture, holding up the folds of their raiment, sped along the hollow road-way, their hair, in colour like the crocus, floating about their shoulders as they went. They found the glorious goddess still sitting by the wayside, unmoved. Then they led her to their father's house; and she, veiled from head to foot, in her deep grief, followed them on the way, and her blue robe gathered itself as she walked, in many folds about her feet. They came to the house, and passed through the sunny porch, where their mother, Metaneira, was [87] sitting against one of the pillars of the roof, having a young child in her bosom. They ran up to her; but Demeter crossed the threshold, and, as she passed through, her head rose and touched the roof, and her presence filled the doorway with a divine brightness. \"Still they did not wholly recognise her. After a time she was made to smile. She refused to drink wine, but tasted of a cup mingled of water and barley, flavoured with mint. It happened that Metaneira had lately borne a child. It had come beyond hope, long after its elder brethren, and was the object of a peculiar tenderness and of many prayers with all. Demeter consented to remain, and become the nurse of this child. She took the child in her immortal hands, and placed it in her fragrant bosom; and the heart of the mother rejoiced. Thus Demeter nursed Demophoon. And the child grew like a god, neither sucking the breast, nor eating bread; but Demeter daily anointed it with ambrosia, as if it had indeed been the child of a god, breathing sweetly over it and holding it in her bosom; and at nights, when she lay alone with the child, she would hide it secretly in the red strength of the fire, like a brand; for her heart yearned towards it, and she would fain have given to it immortal youth. \"But the foolishness of his mother prevented it. For a suspicion growing up within her, she awaited her time, and one night peeped in upon [88] them, and thereupon cried out in terror at what she saw. And the goddess heard her; and a sudden anger seizing her, she plucked the child from the fire and cast it on the ground,--the child she would fain have made immortal, but who must now share the common destiny of all men, though some inscrutable grace should still be his, because he had lain for awhile on the knees and in the bosom of the goddess. \"Then Demeter manifested herself openly. She put away the mask of old age, and changed her form, and the spirit of beauty breathed about her. A fragrant odour fell from her raiment, and her flesh shone from afar; the long yellow hair descended waving over her shoulders, and the great house was filled as with the brightness of lightning. She passed out through the halls; and Metaneira fell to the earth, and was speechless for a long time, and remembered not to lift the child from the ground. But the sisters, hearing its piteous cries, leapt from their beds and ran to it. Then one of them lifted the child from the earth, and wrapped it in her bosom, and another hastened to her mother's chamber to awake her: they came round the child, and washed away the flecks of the fire from its panting body, and kissed it tenderly all about: but the anguish of the child ceased not; the arms of other and different nurses were about to enfold it. \"So, all night, trembling with fear, they [89] sought to propitiate the glorious goddess; and in the morning they told all to their father, Celeus. And he, according to the commands of the goddess, built a fair temple; and all the people assisted; and when it was finished every man departed to his own home. Then Demeter returned, and sat down within the temple-walls, and remained still apart from the company of the gods, alone in her wasting regret for her daughter Persephone. \"And, in her anger, she sent upon the earth a year of grievous famine. The dry seed remained hidden in the soil; in vain the oxen drew the ploughshare through the furrows; much white seed-corn fell fruitless on the earth, and the whole human race had like to have perished, and the gods had no more service of men, unless Zeus had interfered. First he sent Iris, afterwards all the gods, one by one, to turn Demeter from her anger; but none was able to persuade her; she heard their words with a hard countenance, and vowed by no means to return to Olympus, nor to yield the fruit of the earth, until her eyes had seen her lost daughter again. Then, last of all, Zeus sent Hermes into the kingdom of the dead, to persuade Aidoneus to suffer his bride to return to the light of day. And Hermes found the king at home in his palace, sitting on a couch, beside the shrinking Persephone, consumed within herself by desire for her mother. A doubtful smile passed over [90] the face of Aidoneus; yet he obeyed the message, and bade Persephone return; yet praying her a little to have gentle thoughts of him, nor judge him too hardly, who was also an immortal god. And Persephone arose up quickly in great joy; only, ere she departed, he caused her to eat a morsel of sweet pomegranate, designing secretly thereby, that she should not remain always upon earth, but might some time return to him. And Aidoneus yoked the horses to his chariot; and Persephone ascended into it; and Hermes took the reins in his hands and drove out through the infernal halls; and the horses ran willingly; and they two quickly passed over the ways of that long journey, neither the waters of the sea, nor of the rivers, nor the deep ravines of the hills, nor the cliffs of the shore, resisting them; till at last Hermes placed Persephone before the door of the temple where her mother was; who, seeing her, ran out quickly to meet her, like a Maenad coming down a mountain-side, dusky with woods. \"So they spent all that day together in intimate communion, having many things to hear and tell. Then Zeus sent to them Rhea, his venerable mother, the oldest of divine persons, to bring them back reconciled, to the company of the gods; and he ordained that Persephone should remain two parts of the year with her mother, and one third part only with her husband, in the kingdom of the dead. So Demeter suffered [91] the earth to yield its fruits once more, and the land was suddenly laden with leaves and flowers and waving corn. Also she visited Triptolemus and the other princes of Eleusis, and instructed them in the performance of her sacred rites,--those mysteries of which no tongue may speak. Only, blessed is he whose eyes have seen them; his lot after death is not as the lot of other men!\" In the story of Demeter, as in all Greek myths, we may trace the action of three different influences, which have moulded it with varying effects, in three successive phases of its development. There is first its half-conscious, instinctive, or mystical, phase, in which, under the form of an unwritten legend, living from mouth to mouth, and with details changing as it passes from place to place, there lie certain primitive impressions of the phenomena of the natural world. We may trace it next in its conscious, poetical or literary, phase, in which the poets become the depositaries of the vague instinctive product of the popular imagination, and handle it with a purely literary interest, fixing its outlines, and simplifying or developing its situations. Thirdly, the myth passes into the ethical phase, in which the persons and the incidents of the poetical narrative are realised as abstract symbols, because intensely characteristic examples, of moral or spiritual conditions. [92] Behind the adventures of the stealing of Persephone and the wanderings of Demeter in search of her, as we find them in the Homeric hymn, we may discern the confused conception, under which that early age, in which the myths were first created, represented to itself those changes in physical things, that order of summer and winter, of which it had no scientific, or systematic explanation, but in which, nevertheless, it divined a multitude of living agencies, corresponding to those ascertained forces, of which our colder modern science tells the number and the names. Demeter--Demeter and Persephone, at first, in a sort of confused union--is the earth, in the fixed order of its annual changes, but also in all the accident and detail of the growth and decay of its children. Of this conception, floating loosely in the air, the poets of a later age take possession; they create Demeter and Persephone as we know them in art and poetry. From the vague and fluctuating union, in which together they had represented the earth and its changes, the mother and the daughter define themselves with special functions, and with fixed, well-understood relationships, the incidents and emotions of which soon weave themselves into a pathetic story. Lastly, in proportion as the literary or aesthetic activity completes the picture or the poem, the ethical interest makes itself felt. These strange persons--Demeter and Persephone--these marvellous incidents-- the translation into Hades, the seeking [93] of Demeter, the return of Persephone to her,--lend themselves to the elevation and correction of the sentiments of sorrow and awe, by the presentment to the senses and the imagination of an ideal expression of them. Demeter cannot but seem the type of divine grief. Persephone is the goddess of death, yet with a promise of life to come. Those three phases, then, which are more or less discernible in all mythical development, and constitute a natural order in it, based on the necessary conditions of human apprehension, are fixed more plainly, perhaps, than in any other passage of Greek mythology in the story of Demeter. And as the Homeric hymn is the central expression of its literary or poetical phase, so the marble remains, of which I shall have to speak by and bye, are the central extant illustration of what I have called its ethical phase. Homer, in the Iliad, knows Demeter, but only as the goddess of the fields, the originator and patroness of the labours of the countryman, in their yearly order. She stands, with her hair yellow like the ripe corn, at the threshing-floor, and takes her share in the toil, the heap of grain whitening, as the flails, moving in the wind, disperse the chaff. Out in the fresh fields, she yields to the embraces of Iasion, to the extreme jealousy of Zeus, who slays her mortal lover with lightning. The flowery town of Pyrasus--the wheat- town,--an ancient place in Thessaly, is her sacred precinct. But when [94] Homer gives a list of the orthodox gods, her name is not mentioned. Homer, in the Odyssey, knows Persephone also, but not as Kore; only as the queen of the dead--epainê Persephonê+--dreadful Persephone, the goddess of destruction and death, according to the apparent import of her name.+ She accomplishes men's evil prayers; she is the mistress and manager of men's shades, to which she can dispense a little more or less of life, dwelling in her mouldering palace on the steep shore of the Oceanus, with its groves of barren willows and tall poplars. But that Homer knew her as the daughter of Demeter there are no signs; and of his knowledge of the rape of Persephone there is only the faintest sign,--he names Hades by the golden reins of his chariot, and his beautiful horses. The main theme, then, the most characteristic peculiarities, of the story, as subsequently developed, are not to be found, expressly, in the true Homer. We have in him, on the one hand, Demeter, as the perfectly fresh and blithe goddess of the fields, whose children, if she has them, must be as the perfectly discreet and peaceful, unravished Kore; on the other hand, we have Persephone, as the wholly terrible goddess of death, who brings to Ulysses the querulous shadows of the dead, and has the head of the gorgon Medusa in her keeping. And it is only when these two contrasted images have been [95] brought into intimate relationship, only when Kore and Persephone have been identified, that the deeper mythology of Demeter begins. This combination has taken place in Hesiod; and in three lines of the Theogony we find the stealing of Persephone by Aidoneus,*--one of those things in Hesiod, perhaps, which are really older than Homer. Hesiod has been called the poet of helots, and is thought to have preserved some of the traditions of those earlier inhabitants of Greece who had become a kind of serfs; and in a certain shadowiness in his conceptions of the gods, contrasting with the concrete and heroic forms of the gods of Homer, we may perhaps trace something of the quiet unspoken brooding of a subdued people--of that silently dreaming temper to which the story of Persephone properly belongs. However this may be, it is in Hesiod that the two images, unassociated in Homer--the goddess of summer and the goddess of death, Kore and Persephone--are identified with much significance; and that strange, dual being makes her first appearance, whose latent capabilities the poets afterwards developed; among the rest, a peculiar blending of those two contrasted aspects, full of purpose for the duly chastened intelligence; death, resurrection, rejuvenescence.--Awake, and sing, ye that dwell in the dust! [96] Modern science explains the changes of the natural world by the hypothesis of certain unconscious forces; and the sum of these forces, in their combined action, constitutes the scientific conception of nature. But, side by side with the growth of this more mechanical conception, an older and more spiritual, Platonic, philosophy has always maintained itself, a philosophy more of instinct than of the understanding, the mental starting-point of which is not an observed sequence of outward phenomena, but some such feeling as most of us have on the first warmer days in spring, when we seem to feel the genial processes of nature actually at work; as if just below the mould, and in the hard wood of the trees, there were really circulating some spirit of life, akin to that which makes its energies felt within ourselves. Starting with a hundred instincts such as this, that older unmechanical, spiritual, or Platonic, philosophy envisages nature rather as the unity of a living spirit or person, revealing itself in various degrees to the kindred spirit of the observer, than as a system of mechanical forces. Such a philosophy is a systematised form of that sort of poetry (we may study it, for instance, either in Shelley or in Wordsworth), which also has its fancies of a spirit of the earth, or of the sky,--a personal intelligence abiding in them, the existence of which is assumed in every suggestion such poetry makes to us of a sympathy between the ways [97] and aspects of outward nature and the moods of men. And what stood to the primitive intelligence in place of such metaphysical conceptions were those cosmical stories or myths, such as this of Demeter and Persephone, which springing up spontaneously in many minds, came at last to represent to them, in a certain number of sensibly realised images, all they knew, felt, or fancied, of the natural world about them. The sky in its unity and its variety,--the sea in its unity and its variety,--mirrored themselves respectively in these simple, but profoundly impressible spirits, as Zeus, as Glaucus or Poseidon. And a large part of their experience--all, that is, that related to the earth in its changes, the growth and decay of all things born of it--was covered by the story of Demeter, the myth of the earth as a mother. They thought of Demeter as the old Germans thought of Hertha, or the later Greeks of Pan, as the Egyptians thought of Isis, the land of the Nile, made green by the streams of Osiris, for whose coming Isis longs, as Demeter for Persephone; thus naming together in her all their fluctuating thoughts, impressions, suspicions, of the earth and its appearances, their whole complex divination of a mysterious life, a perpetual working, a continuous act of conception there. Or they thought of the many-coloured earth as the garment of Demeter, as the great modern pantheist poet speaks of it as the \"garment of God.\" Its [98] brooding fertility; the spring flowers breaking from its surface, the thinly disguised unhealthfulness of their heavy perfume, and of their chosen places of growth; the delicate, feminine, Prosperina-like motion of all growing things; its fruit, full of drowsy and poisonous, or fresh, reviving juices; its sinister caprices also, its droughts and sudden volcanic heats; the long delays of spring; its dumb sleep, so suddenly flung away; the sadness which insinuates itself into its languid luxuriance; all this grouped itself round the persons of Demeter and her circle. They could turn always to her, from the actual earth itself, in aweful yet hopeful prayer, and a devout personal gratitude, and explain it through her, in its sorrow and its promise, its darkness and its helpfulness to man. The personification of abstract ideas by modern painters or sculptors, of wealth, of commerce, of health, for instance, shocks, in most cases, the aesthetic sense, as something conventional or rhetorical, as a mere transparent allegory, or figure of speech, which could please almost no one. On the other hand, such symbolical representations, under the form of human persons, as Giotto's Virtues and Vices at Padua, or his Saint Poverty at Assisi, or the series of the planets in certain early Italian engravings, are profoundly poetical and impressive. They seem to be something more than mere symbolism, [99] and to be connected with some peculiarly sympathetic penetration, on the part of the artist, into the subjects he intended to depict. Symbolism intense as this, is the creation of a special temper, in which a certain simplicity, taking all things literally, au pied de la lettre, is united to a vivid pre-occupation with the aesthetic beauty of the image itself, the figured side of figurative expression, the form of the metaphor. When it is said, \"Out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword,\" that temper is ready to deal directly and boldly with that difficult image, like that old designer of the fourteenth century, who has depicted this, and other images of the Apocalypse, in a coloured window at Bourges. Such symbolism cares a great deal for the hair of Temperance, discreetly bound, for some subtler likeness to the colour of the sky in the girdle of Hope, for the inwoven flames in the red garment of Charity. And what was specially peculiar to the temper of the old Florentine painter, Giotto, to the temper of his age in general, doubtless, more than to that of ours, was the persistent and universal mood of the age in which the story of Demeter and Persephone was first created. If some painter of our own time has conceived the image of The Day so intensely, that we hardly think of distinguishing between the image, with its girdle of dissolving morning mist, and the meaning of the image; if William Blake, to our so great delight, makes the morning stars [100] literally \"sing together,\"--these fruits of individual genius are in part also a \"survival\" from a different age, with the whole mood of which this mode of expression was more congruous than it is with ours. But there are traces of the old temper in the man of to-day also; and through these we can understand that earlier time--a very poetical time, with the more highly gifted peoples--in which every impression men received of the action of powers without or within them suggested to them the presence of a soul or will, like their own--a person, with a living spirit, and senses, and hands, and feet; which, when it talked of the return of Kore to Demeter, or the marriage of Zeus and Here, was not using rhetorical language, but yielding to a real illusion; to which the voice of man \"was really a stream, beauty an effluence, death a mist.\" The gods of Greek mythology overlap each other; they are confused or connected with each other, lightly or deeply, as the case may be, and sometimes have their doubles, at first sight as in a troubled dream, yet never, when we examine each detail more closely, without a certain truth to human reason. It is only in a limited sense that it is possible to lift, and examine by itself, one thread of the network of story and imagery, which, in a certain age of civilisation, wove itself over every detail of life and thought, over every name in the past, and almost every place in [101] Greece. The story of Demeter, then, was the work of no single author or place or time; the poet of its first phase was no single person, but the whole consciousness of an age, though an age doubtless with its differences of more or less imaginative individual minds--with one, here or there, eminent, though but by a little, above a merely receptive majority, the spokesman of a universal, though faintly-felt prepossession, attaching the errant fancies of the people around him to definite names and images. The myth grew up gradually, and at many distant places, in many minds, independent of each other, but dealing in a common temper with certain elements and aspects of the natural world, as one here, and another there, seemed to catch in that incident or detail which flashed more incisively than others on the inward eye, some influence, or feature, or characteristic of the great mother. The various epithets of Demeter, the local variations of her story, its incompatible incidents, bear witness to the manner of its generation. They illustrate that indefiniteness which is characteristic of Greek mythology, a theology with no central authority, no link on historic time, liable from the first to an unobserved transformation. They indicate the various, far-distant spots from which the visible body of the goddess slowly collected its constituents, and came at last to have a well-defined existence in the popular mind. In this sense, Demeter appears to one in [102] her anger, sullenly withholding the fruits of the earth, to another in her pride of Persephone, to another in her grateful gift of the arts of agriculture to man; at last only, is there a general recognition of a clearly-arrested outline, a tangible embodiment, which has solidified itself in the imagination of the people, they know not how. The worship of Demeter belongs to that older religion, nearer to the earth, which some have thought they could discern, behind the more definitely national mythology of Homer. She is the goddess of dark caves, and is not wholly free from monstrous form. She gave men the first fig in one place, the first poppy in another; in another, she first taught the old Titans to mow. She is the mother of the vine also; and the assumed name by which she called herself in her wanderings, is Dôs--a gift; the crane, as the harbinger of rain, is her messenger among the birds. She knows the magic powers of certain plants, cut from her bosom, to bane or bless; and, under one of her epithets, herself presides over the springs, as also coming from the secret places of the earth. She is the goddess, then, at first, of the fertility of the earth in its wildness; and so far, her attributes are to some degree confused with those of the Thessalian Gaia and the Phrygian Cybele. Afterwards, and it is now that her most characteristic attributes begin to concentrate themselves, [103] she separates herself from these confused relationships, as specially the goddess of agriculture, of the fertility of the earth when furthered by human skill. She is the preserver of the seed sown in hope, under many epithets derived from the incidents of vegetation, as the simple countryman names her, out of a mind full of the various experiences of his little garden or farm. She is the most definite embodiment of all those fluctuating mystical instincts, of which Gaia,* the mother of the earth's gloomier offspring, is a vaguer and mistier one. There is nothing of the confused outline, the mere shadowiness of mystical dreaming, in this most concrete human figure. No nation, less aesthetically gifted than the Greeks, could have thus lightly thrown its mystical surmise and divination into images so clear and idyllic as those of the solemn goddess of the country, in whom the characteristics of the mother are expressed with so much tenderness, and the \"beauteous head\" of Kore, then so fresh and peaceful. In this phase, then, the story of Demeter appears as the peculiar creation of country-people of a high impressibility, dreaming over their work in spring or autumn, half consciously touched by a sense of its sacredness, and a sort of [104] mystery about it. For there is much in the life of the farm everywhere which gives to persons of any seriousness of disposition, special opportunity for grave and gentle thoughts. The temper of people engaged in the occupations of country life, so permanent, so \"near to nature,\" is at all times alike; and the habitual solemnity of thought and expression which Wordsworth found in the peasants of Cumberland, and the painter François Millet in the peasants of Brittany, may well have had its prototype in early Greece. And so, even before the development, by the poets, of their aweful and passionate story, Demeter and Persephone seem to have been pre-eminently the venerable, or aweful, goddesses. Demeter haunts the fields in spring, when the young lambs are dropped; she visits the barns in autumn; she takes part in mowing and binding up the corn, and is the goddess of sheaves. She presides over all the pleasant, significant details of the farm, the threshing-floor and the full granary, and stands beside the woman baking bread at the oven. With these fancies are connected certain simple rites; the half-understood local observance, and the half- believed local legend, reacting capriciously on each other. They leave her a fragment of bread and a morsel of meat, at the cross- roads, to take on her journey; and perhaps some real Demeter carries them away, as she wanders through the country. The incidents of their yearly labour become to [105] them acts of worship; they seek her blessing through many expressive names, and almost catch sight of her, at dawn or evening, in the nooks of the fragrant fields. She lays a finger on the grass at the road-side, and some new flower comes up. All the picturesque implements of country life are hers; the poppy also, emblem of an inexhaustible fertility, and full of mysterious juices for the alleviation of pain. The countrywoman who puts her child to sleep in the great, cradle-like, basket, for winnowing the corn, remembers Demeter Courotrophos, the mother of corn and children alike, and makes it a little coat out of the dress worn by its father at his initiation into her mysteries. Yet she is an angry goddess too, sometimes--Demeter Erinnys, the goblin of the neighbourhood, haunting its shadowy places. She lies on the ground out of doors on summer nights, and becomes wet with the dew. She grows young again every spring, yet is of great age, the wrinkled woman of the Homeric hymn, who becomes the nurse of Demophoon. Other lighter, errant stories nest themselves, as time goes on, within the greater. The water-newt, which repels the lips of the traveller who stoops to drink, is a certain urchin, Abas, who spoiled by his mockery the pleasure of the thirsting goddess, as she drank once of a wayside spring in her wanderings. The night-owl is the transformed Ascalabus, who alone had seen Persephone eat that morsel [106] of pomegranate, in the garden of Aidoneus. The bitter wild mint was once a girl, who for a moment had made her jealous, in Hades. The episode of Triptolemus, to whom Demeter imparts the mysteries of the plough, like the details of some sacred rite, that he may bear them abroad to all people, embodies, in connexion with her, another group of the circumstances of country life. As with all the other episodes of the story, there are here also local variations, traditions of various favourites of the goddess at different places, of whom grammarians can tell us, finally obscured behind the greater fame of Triptolemus of Eleusis. One might fancy, at first, that Triptolemus was a quite Boeotian divinity, of the ploughshare. Yet we know that the thoughts of the Greeks concerning the culture of the earth from which they came, were most often noble ones; and if we examine carefully the works of ancient art which represent him, the second thought will suggest itself, that there was nothing clumsy or coarse about this patron of the plough--something, rather, of the movement of delicate wind or fire, about him and his chariot. And this finer character is explained, if, as we are justified in doing, we bring him into closest connexion with that episode, so full of a strange mysticism, of the Nursing of Demophoon, in the Homeric hymn. For, according to some traditions, none other [107] than Triptolemus himself was the subject of that mysterious experiment, in which Demeter laid the child nightly, in the red heat of the fire; and he lives afterwards, not immortal indeed, not wholly divine, yet, as Shakspere says, a \"nimble spirit,\" feeling little of the weight of the material world about him--the element of winged fire in the clay. The delicate, fresh, farm-lad we may still actually see sometimes, like a graceful field-flower among the corn, becomes, in the sacred legend of agriculture, a king's son; and then, the fire having searched out from him the grosser elements on that famous night, all compact now of spirit, a priest also, administering the gifts of Demeter to all the earth. Certainly, the extant works of art which represent him, gems or vase-paintings, conform truly enough to this ideal of a \"nimble spirit,\" though he wears the broad country hat, which Hermes also wears, going swiftly, half on the airy, mercurial wheels of his farm instrument, harrow or plough--half on wings of serpents--the worm, symbolical of the soil, but winged, as sending up the dust committed to it, after subtle firing, in colours and odours of fruit and flowers. It is an altogether sacred character, again, that he assumes in another precious work, of the severer period of Greek art, lately discovered at Eleusis, and now preserved in the museum of Athens, a singularly refined bas-relief, in which he stands, a firm and serious youth, between Demeter and [108] Persephone, who places her hand as with some sacred influence, and consecrating gesture, upon him. But the house of the prudent countryman will be, of course, a place of honest manners; and Demeter Thesmophoros is the guardian of married life, the deity of the discretion of wives. She is therefore the founder of civilised order. The peaceful homes of men, scattered about the land, in their security--Demeter represents these fruits of the earth also, not without a suggestion of the white cities, which shine upon the hills above the waving fields of corn, seats of justice and of true kingship. She is also in a certain sense the patron of travellers, having, in her long wanderings after Persephone, recorded and handed down those omens, caught from little things--the birds which crossed her path, the persons who met her on the way, the words they said, the things they carried in their hands, einodia symbola+--by noting which, men bring their journeys to a successful end; so that the simple countryman may pass securely on his way; and is led by signs from the goddess herself, when he travels far to visit her, at Hermione or Eleusis. So far the attributes of Demeter and Kore are similar. In the mythical conception, as in the religious acts connected with it, the mother and the daughter are almost interchangeable; [109] they are the two goddesses, the twin-named. Gradually, the office of Persephone is developed, defines itself; functions distinct from those of Demeter are attributed to her. Hitherto, always at the side of Demeter and sharing her worship, she now appears detached from her, going and coming, on her mysterious business. A third part of the year she abides in darkness; she comes up in the spring; and every autumn, when the countryman sows his seed in the earth, she descends thither again, and the world of the dead lies open, spring and autumn, to let her in and out. Persephone, then, is the summer- time, and, in this sense, a daughter of the earth; but the summer as bringing winter; the flowery splendour and consummated glory of the year, as thereafter immediately beginning to draw near to its end, as the first yellow leaf crosses it, in the first severer wind. She is the last day of spring, or the first day of autumn, in the threefold division of the Greek year. Her story is, indeed, but the story, in an intenser form, of Adonis, of Hyacinth, of Adrastus--the king's blooming son, fated, in the story of Herodotus, to be wounded to death with an iron spear--of Linus, a fair child who is torn to pieces by hounds every spring-time--of the English Sleeping Beauty. From being the goddess of summer and the flowers, she becomes the goddess of night and sleep and death, confuseable with Hecate, the goddess of midnight [110] terrors--Korê arrêtos,+ the mother of the Erinnyes, who appeared to Pindar, to warn him of his approaching death, upbraiding him because he had made no hymn in her praise, which swan's song he thereupon began, but finished with her. She is a twofold goddess, therefore, according as one or the other of these two contrasted aspects of her nature is seized, respectively. A duality, an inherent opposition in the very conception of Persephone, runs all through her story, and is part of her ghostly power. There is ever something in her of a divided or ambiguous identity: hence the many euphemisms of later language concerning her. The \"worship of sorrow,\" as Goethe called it, is sometimes supposed to have had almost no place in the religion of the Greeks. Their religion has been represented as a religion of mere cheerfulness, the worship by an untroubled, unreflecting humanity, conscious of no deeper needs, of the embodiments of its own joyous activity. It helped to hide out of their sight those traces of decay and weariness, of which the Greeks were constitutionally shy, to keep them from peeping too curiously into certain shadowy places, appropriate enough to the gloomy imagination of the middle age; and it hardly proposed to itself to give consolation to people who, in truth, were never \"sick or sorry.\" But this familiar view of Greek religion is based on a consideration of a part only of what is known [111] concerning it, and really involves a misconception, akin to that which underestimates the influence of the romantic spirit generally, in Greek poetry and art; as if Greek art had dealt exclusively with human nature in its sanity, suppressing all motives of strangeness, all the beauty which is born of difficulty, permitting nothing but an Olympian, though perhaps somewhat wearisome calm. In effect, such a conception of Greek art and poetry leaves in the central expressions of Greek culture none but negative qualities; and the legend of Demeter and Persephone, perhaps the most popular of all Greek legends, is sufficient to show that the \"worship of sorrow\" was not without its function in Greek religion; their legend is a legend made by and for sorrowful, wistful, anxious people; while the most important artistic monuments of that legend sufficiently prove that the Romantic spirit was really at work in the minds of Greek artists, extracting by a kind of subtle alchemy, a beauty, not without the elements of tranquillity, of dignity and order, out of a matter, at first sight painful and strange. The student of origins, as French critics say, of the earliest stages of art and poetry, must be content to follow faint traces; and in what has been here said, much may seem to have been made of little, with too much completion, by a general framework or setting, of what after [112] all are but doubtful or fragmentary indications. Yet there is a certain cynicism too, in that over-positive temper, which is so jealous of our catching any resemblance in the earlier world to the thoughts that really occupy our own minds, and which, in its estimate of the actual fragments of antiquity, is content to find no seal of human intelligence upon them. Slight indeed in themselves, these fragmentary indications become suggestive of much, when viewed in the light of such general evidence about the human imagination as is afforded by the theory of \"comparative mythology,\" or what is called the theory of \"animism.\" Only, in the application of these theories, the student of Greek religion must never forget that, after all, it is with poetry, not with systematic theological belief or dogma, that he has to do. As regards this story of Demeter and Persephone, what we actually possess is some actual fragments of poetry, some actual fragments of sculpture; and with a curiosity, justified by the direct aesthetic beauty of these fragments, we feel our way backwards to that engaging picture of the poet-people, with which the ingenuity of modern theory has filled the void in our knowledge. The abstract poet of that first period of mythology, creating in this wholly impersonal, intensely spiritual way,--the abstract spirit of poetry itself, rises before the mind; and, in speaking of this poetical age, we must take heed, before all things, in no sense to misconstrue the poets.

In that world of floating fancies there was a struggle for life; there were myths which never emerged from that first stage of popular conception, or were absorbed by stronger competitors, because, as some true heroes have done, they lacked the sacred poet or prophet, and were never remodelled by literature; while, out of the myth of Demeter, under the careful conduct of poetry and art, came the little pictures, the idylls, of the Homeric hymn, and the gracious imagery of Praxiteles. The myth has now entered its second or poetical phase, then, in which more definite fancies are grouped about the primitive stock, in a conscious literary temper, and the whole interest settles round the images of the beautiful girl going down into the darkness, and the weary woman who seeks her lost daughter--divine persons, then sincerely believed in by the majority of the Greeks. The Homeric hymn [114] is the central monument of this second phase. In it, the changes of the natural year have become a personal history, a story of human affection and sorrow, yet with a far-reaching religious significance also, of which the mere earthly spring and autumn are but an analogy; and in the development of this human element, the writer of the hymn sometimes displays a genuine power of pathetic expression. The whole episode of the fostering of Demophoon, in which over the body of the dying child human longing and regret are blent so subtly with the mysterious design of the goddess to make the child immortal, is an excellent example of the sentiment of pity in literature. Yet though it has reached the stage of conscious literary interpretation, much of its early mystical or cosmical character still lingers about the story, as it is here told. Later mythologists simply define the personal history; but in this hymn we may, again and again, trace curious links of connexion with the original purpose of the myth. Its subject is the weary woman, indeed, our Lady of Sorrows, the mater dolorosa of the ancient world, but with a certain latent reference, all through, to the mystical person of the earth. Her robe of dark blue is the raiment of her mourning, but also the blue robe of the earth in shadow, as we see it in Titian's landscapes; her great age is the age of the immemorial earth; she becomes a nurse, therefore, holding Demophoon in her bosom; [115] the folds of her garment are fragrant, not merely with the incense of Eleusis, but with the natural perfume of flowers and fruit. The sweet breath with which she nourishes the child Demophoon, is the warm west wind, feeding all germs of vegetable life; her bosom, where he lies, is the bosom of the earth, with its strengthening heat, reserved and shy, offended if human eyes scrutinise too closely its secret chemistry; it is with the earth's natural surface of varied colour that she has, \"in time past, given pleasure to the sun\"; the yellow hair which falls suddenly over her shoulders, at her transformation in the house of Celeus, is still partly the golden corn;--in art and poetry she is ever the blond goddess; tarrying in her temple, of which an actual hollow in the earth is the prototype, among the spicy odours of the Eleusinian ritual, she is the spirit of the earth, lying hidden in its dark folds until the return of spring, among the flower-seeds and fragrant roots, like the seeds and aromatic woods hidden in the wrappings of the dead. Throughout the poem, we have a sense of a certain nearness to nature, surviving from an earlier world; the sea is understood as a person, yet is still the real sea, with the waves moving. When it is said that no bird gave Demeter tidings of Persephone, we feel that to that earlier world, ways of communication between all creatures may have seemed open, which are closed to us. It is Iris who brings to Demeter the message of Zeus; [116] that is, the rainbow signifies to the earth the good-will of the rainy sky towards it. Persephone springing up with great joy from the couch of Aidoneus, to return to her mother, is the sudden outburst of the year. The heavy and narcotic aroma of spring flowers hangs about her, as about the actual spring. And this mingling of the primitive cosmical import of the myth with the later, personal interests of the story, is curiously illustrated by the place which the poem assigns to Hecate. This strange Titaness is, first, a nymph only; afterwards, as if changed incurably by the passionate cry of Persephone, she becomes her constant attendant, and is even identified with her. But in the Homeric hymn her lunar character is clear; she is really the moon only, who hears the cry of Persephone, as the sun saw her, when Aidoneus carried her away. One morning, as the mother wandered, the moon appeared, as it does in its last quarter, rising very bright, just before dawn; that is, in the words of the Homeric hymn--\"on the tenth morning Hecate met her, having a light in her hands.\" The fascinating, but enigmatical figure, \"sitting ever in her cave, half-veiled with a shining veil, thinking delicate thoughts,\" in which we seem to see the subject of some picture of the Italian Renaissance, is but the lover of Endymion-- like Persephone, withdrawn, in her season, from the eyes of men. The sun saw her; the moon saw her not, but heard her cry, and is [117] ever after the half-veiled attendant of the queen of dreams and of the dead. But the story of Demeter and Persephone lends itself naturally to description, and it is in descriptive beauties that the Homeric hymn excels; its episodes are finished designs, and directly stimulate the painter and the sculptor to a rivalry with them. Weaving the names of the flowers into his verse, names familiar to us in English, though their Greek originals are uncertain, the writer sets Persephone before us, herself like one of them--kalykôpis+--like the budding calyx of a flower,--in a picture, which, in its mingling of a quaint freshness and simplicity with a certain earnestness, reads like a description of some early Florentine design, such as Sandro Botticelli's Allegory of the Seasons. By an exquisite chance also, a common metrical expression connects the perfume of the newly-created narcissus with the salt odour of the sea. Like one of those early designs also, but with a deeper infusion of religious earnestness, is the picture of Demeter sitting at the wayside, in shadow as always, with the well of water and the olive-tree. She has been journeying all night, and now it is morning, and the daughters of Celeus bring their vessels to draw water. That image of the seated Demeter, resting after her long flight \"through the dark continent,\" or in the house of Celeus, when she refuses the red wine, or again, solitary, in her newly-finished [118] temple of Eleusis, enthroned in her grief, fixed itself deeply on the Greek imagination, and became a favourite subject of Greek artists. When the daughters of Celeus come to conduct her to Eleusis, they come as in a Greek frieze, full of energy and motion and waving lines, but with gold and colours upon it. Eleusis--coming--the coming of Demeter thither, as thus told in the Homeric hymn, is the central instance in Greek mythology of such divine appearances. \"She leaves for a season the company of the gods and abides among men;\" and men's merit is to receive her in spite of appearances. Metaneira and others, in the Homeric hymn, partly detect her divine character; they find charis+;--a certain gracious air--about her, which makes them think her, perhaps, a royal person in disguise. She becomes in her long wanderings almost wholly humanised, and in return, she and Persephone, alone of the Greek gods, seem to have been the objects of a sort of personal love and loyalty. Yet they are ever the solemn goddesses,--theai semnai,+ the word expressing religious awe, the Greek sense of the divine presence. Plato, in laying down the rules by which the poets are to be guided in speaking about divine things to the citizens of the ideal republic, forbids all those episodes of mythology which represent the gods as assuming various forms, and visiting the earth in disguise. Below the [119] express reasons which he assigns for this rule, we may perhaps detect that instinctive antagonism to the old Heraclitean philosophy of perpetual change, which forces him, in his theory of morals and the state, of poetry and music, of dress and manners even, and of style in the very vessels and furniture of daily life, on an austere simplicity, the older Dorian or Egyptian type of a rigid, eternal immobility. The disintegrating, centrifugal influence, which had penetrated, as he thought, political and social existence, making men too myriad-minded, had laid hold on the life of the gods also, and, even in their calm sphere, one could hardly identify a single divine person as himself, and not another. There must, then, be no doubling, no disguises, no stories of transformation. The modern reader, however, will hardly acquiesce in this \"improvement\" of Greek mythology. He finds in these stories, like that, for instance, of the appearance of Athene to Telemachus, in the first book of the Odyssey, which has a quite biblical mysticity and solemnity,--stories in which, the hard material outline breaking up, the gods lay aside their visible form like a garment, yet remain essentially themselves,--not the least spiritual element of Greek religion, an evidence of the sense therein of unseen presences, which might at any moment cross a man's path, to be recognised, in half disguise, by the more delicately trained eye, here or there, by one and not by [120] another. Whatever religious elements they lacked, they had at least this sense of subtler and more remote ways of personal presence. And as there are traces in the Homeric hymn of the primitive cosmical myth, relics of the first stage of the development of the story, so also many of its incidents are probably suggested by the circumstances and details of the Eleusinian ritual. There were religious usages before there were distinct religious conceptions, and these antecedent religious usages shape and determine, at many points, the ultimate religious conception, as the details of the myth interpret or explain the religious custom. The hymn relates the legend of certain holy places, to which various impressive religious rites had attached themselves--the holy well, the old fountain, the stone of sorrow, which it was the office of the \"interpreter\" of the holy places to show to the people. The sacred way which led from Athens to Eleusis was rich in such memorials. The nine days of the wanderings of Demeter in the Homeric hymn are the nine days of the duration of the greater or autumnal mysteries; the jesting of the old woman Iambe, who endeavours to make Demeter smile, are the customary mockeries with which the worshippers, as they rested on the bridge, on the seventh day of the feast, assailed those who passed by. The torches in the hands of Demeter are borrowed from the same source; and the shadow in which she is [121] constantly represented, and which is the peculiar sign of her grief, is partly ritual, and a relic of the caves of the old Chthonian worship, partly poetical-- expressive, half of the dark earth to which she escapes from Olympus, half of her mourning. She appears consistently, in the hymn, as a teacher of rites, transforming daily life, and the processes of life, into a religious solemnity. With no misgiving as to the proprieties of a mere narration, the hymn-writer mingles these symbolical imitations with the outlines of the original story; and, in his Demeter, the dramatic person of the mysteries mixes itself with the primitive mythical figure. And the worshipper, far from being offended by these interpolations, may have found a special impressiveness in them, as they linked continuously its inner sense with the outward imagery of the ritual. And, as Demeter and her story embodied themselves gradually in the Greek imagination, so these mysteries in which her worship found its chief expression, grew up little by little, growing always in close connexion with the modifications of the story, sometimes prompting them, at other times suggested by them. That they had a single special author is improbable, and a mere invention of the Greeks, ignorant of their real history and the general analogy of such matters. Here again, as in the story itself, the idea of development, of degrees, of a slow [122] and natural growth, impeded here, diverted there, is the illuminating thought which earlier critics lacked. \"No tongue may speak of them,\" says the Homeric hymn; and the secret has certainly been kept. The antiquarian, dealing, letter by letter, with what is recorded of them, has left few certain data for the reflexion of the modern student of the Greek religion; and of this, its central solemnity, only a fragmentary picture can be made. It is probable that these mysteries developed the symbolical significance of the story of the descent into Hades, the coming of Demeter to Eleusis, the invention of Persephone. They may or may not have been the vehicle of a secret doctrine, but were certainly an artistic spectacle, giving, like the mysteries of the middle age, a dramatic representation of the sacred story,--perhaps a detailed performance, perhaps only such a conventional representation, as was afforded for instance by the medieval ceremonies of Palm Sunday; the whole, probably, centering in an image of Demeter--the work of Praxiteles or his school, in ivory and gold. There is no reason to suppose any specific difference between the observances of the Eleusinian festival and the accustomed usages of the Greek religion; nocturns, libations, quaint purifications, processions--are common incidents of all Greek worship; in all religious ceremonies there is an element of dramatic symbolism; and what we really do see, through those scattered notices, [123] are things which have their parallels in a later age, the whole being not altogether unlike a modern pilgrimage. The exposition of the sacred places--the threshing-floor of Triptolemus, the rocky seat on which Demeter had rested in her sorrow, the well of Callichorus--is not so strange, as it would seem, had it no modern illustration. The libations, at once a watering of the vines and a drink-offering to the dead--still needing men's services, waiting for purification perhaps, or thirsting, like Dante's Adam of Brescia, in their close homes--must, to almost all minds, have had a certain natural impressiveness; and a parallel has sometimes been drawn between this festival and All Souls' Day. And who, everywhere, has not felt the mystical influence of that prolonged silence, the mystic silence, from which the very word \"mystery\" has its origin? Something also there undoubtedly was, which coarser minds might misunderstand. On one day, the initiated went in procession to the sea-coast, where they underwent a purification by bathing in the sea. On the fifth night there was the torchlight procession; and, by a touch of real life in him, we gather from the first page of Plato's Republic that such processions were popular spectacles, having a social interest, so that people made much of attending them. There was the procession of the sacred basket filled with poppy-seeds and pomegranates. There was the day of rest, after [124] the stress and excitement of the \"great night.\" On the sixth day, the image of Iacchus, son of Demeter, crowned with myrtle and having a torch in its hand, was carried in procession, through thousands of spectators, along the sacred way, amid joyous shouts and songs. We have seen such processions; we understand how many different senses, and how lightly, various spectators may put on them; how little definite meaning they may have even for those who officiate in them. Here, at least, there was the image itself, in that age, with its close connexion between religion and art, presumably fair. Susceptibility to the impressions of religious ceremonial must always have varied with the peculiarities of individual temperament, as it varies in our own day; and Eleusis, with its incense and sweet singing, may have been as little interesting to the outward senses of some worshippers there, as the stately and affecting ceremonies of the medieval church to many of its own members. In a simpler yet profounder sense than has sometimes been supposed, these things were really addressed to the initiated only.* We have to travel a long way from the Homeric hymn to the hymn of Callimachus, who writes in the end of Greek literature, in the third century before Christ, in celebration of the procession of the sacred basket of Demeter, not [125] at the Attic, but at the Alexandrian Eleusinia. He developes, in something of the prosaic spirit of a medieval writer of \"mysteries,\" one of the burlesque incidents of the story, the insatiable hunger which seized on Erysichthon because he cut down a grove sacred to the goddess. Yet he finds his opportunities for skilful touches of poetry;--\"As the four white horses draw her sacred basket,\" he says, \"so will the great goddess bring us a white spring, a white summer.\" He describes the grove itself, with its hedge of trees, so thick that an arrow could hardly pass through, its pines and fruit-trees and tall poplars within, and the water, like pale gold, running from the conduits. It is one of those famous poplars that receives the first stroke; it sounds heavily to its companion trees, and Demeter perceives that her sacred grove is suffering. Then comes one of those transformations which Plato will not allow. Vainly anxious to save the lad from his ruin, she appears in the form of a priestess, but with the long hood of the goddess, and the poppy in her hand; and there is something of a real shudder, some still surviving sense of a haunting presence in the groves, in the verses which describe her sudden revelation, when the workmen flee away, leaving their axes in the cleft trees. Of the same age as the hymn of Callimachus, but with very different qualities, is the idyll of Theocritus on the Shepherds' Journey. Although it is possible to define an epoch in mythological [126] development in which literary and artificial influences began to remodel the primitive, popular legend, yet still, among children, and unchanging childlike people, we may suppose that that primitive stage always survived, and the old, instinctive influences were still at work. As the subject of popular religious celebrations also, the myth was still the property of the people, and surrendered to its capricious action. The shepherds in Theocritus, on their way to celebrate one of the more homely feasts of Demeter, about the time of harvest, are examples of these childlike people; the age of the poets has long since come, but they are of the older and simpler order, lingering on in the midst of a more self-conscious world. In an idyll, itself full of the delightful gifts of Demeter, Theocritus sets them before us; through the blazing summer day's journey, the smiling image of the goddess is always before them; and now they have reached the end of their journey:-- \"So I, and Eucritus, and the fair Amyntichus, turned aside into the house of Phrasidamus, and lay down with delight in beds of sweet tamarisk and fresh cuttings from the vines, strewn on the ground. Many poplars and elm-trees were waving over our heads, and not far off the running of the sacred water from the cave of the nymphs warbled to us; in the shimmering branches the sun-burnt grasshoppers were busy with their talk, and from afar the little owl cried softly, out of [127] the tangled thorns of the blackberry; the larks were singing and the hedge-birds, and the turtle-dove moaned; the bees flew round and round the fountains, murmuring softly; the scent of late summer and of the fall of the year was everywhere; the pears fell from the trees at our feet, and apples in number rolled down at our sides, and the young plum-trees were bent to the earth with the weight of their fruit. The wax, four years old, was loosed from the heads of the wine-jars. O! nymphs of Castalia, who dwell on the steeps of Parnassus, tell me, I pray you, was it a draught like this that the aged Chiron placed before Hercules, in the stony cave of Pholus? Was it nectar like this that made the mighty shepherd on Anapus' shore, Polyphemus, who flung the rocks upon Ulysses' ships, dance among his sheepfolds?--A cup like this ye poured out now upon the altar of Demeter, who presides over the threshing-floor. May it be mine, once more, to dig my big winnowing-fan through her heaps of corn; and may I see her smile upon me, holding poppies and handfuls of corn in her two hands!\" Some of the modifications of the story of Demeter, as we find it in later poetry, have been supposed to be due, not to the genuine action of the Greek mind, but to the influence of that so-called Orphic literature, which, in the generation succeeding Hesiod, brought, from Thessaly and Phrygia, a tide of mystical ideas into the Greek [128] religion, sometimes, doubtless, confusing the clearness and naturalness of its original outlines, but also sometimes imparting to them a new and peculiar grace. Under the influence of this Orphic poetry, Demeter was blended, or identified, with Rhea Cybele, the mother of the gods, the wilder earth-goddess of Phrygia; and the romantic figure of Dionysus Zagreus, Dionysus the Hunter, that most interesting, though somewhat melancholy variation on the better known Dionysus, was brought, as son or brother of Persephone, into her circle, the mystical vine, who, as Persephone descends and ascends from the earth, is rent to pieces by the Titans every year and remains long in Hades, but every spring-time comes out of it again, renewing his youth. This identification of Demeter with Rhea Cybele is the motive which has inspired a beautiful chorus in the Helena-- the new Helena--of Euripides, that great lover of all subtle refinements and modernisms, who, in this play, has worked on a strange version of the older story, which relates that Helen had never really gone to Troy at all, but sent her soul only there, apart from her sweet body, which abode all that time in Egypt, at the court of King Proteus, where she is found at last by her husband Menelaus, so that the Trojan war was about a phantom, after all. The chorus has even less than usual to do with the action of the play, being linked to it only by a sort of parallel, which may be understood, [129] between Menelaus seeking Helen, and Demeter seeking Persephone. Euripides, then, takes the matter of the Homeric hymn into the region of a higher and swifter poetry, and connects it with the more stimulating imagery of the Idaean mother. The Orphic mysticism or enthusiasm has been admitted into the story, which is now full of excitement, the motion of rivers, the sounds of the Bacchic cymbals heard over the mountains, as Demeter wanders among the woody valleys seeking her lost daughter, all directly expressed in the vivid Greek words. Demeter is no longer the subdued goddess of the quietly- ordered fields, but the mother of the gods, who has her abode in the heights of Mount Ida, who presides over the dews and waters of the white springs, whose flocks feed, not on grain, but on the curling tendrils of the vine, both of which she withholds in her anger, and whose chariot is drawn by wild beasts, fruit and emblem of the earth in its fiery strength. Not Hecate, but Pallas and Artemis, in full armour, swift-footed, vindicators of chastity, accompany her in her search for Persephone, who is already expressly, korê arrêtos+--\"the maiden whom none may name.\" When she rests from her long wanderings, it is into the stony thickets of Mount Ida, deep with snow, that she throws herself, in her profound grief. When Zeus desires to end her pain, the Muses and the \"solemn\" Graces are sent to dance and sing before her. It is then [130] that Cypris, the goddess of beauty, and the original cause, therefore, of her distress, takes into her hands the brazen tambourines of the Dionysiac worship with their Chthonian or deep-noted sound; and it is she, not the old Iambe, who with this wild music, heard thus for the first time, makes Demeter smile at last. \"Great,\" so the chorus ends with a picture, \"great is the power of the stoles of spotted fawn-skins, and the green leaves of ivy twisted about the sacred wands, and the wheeling motion of the tambourine whirled round in the air, and the long hair floating unbound in honour of Bromius, and the nocturns of the goddess, when the moon looks full upon them.\" The poem of Claudian on the Rape of Proserpine, the longest extant work connected with the story of Demeter, yet itself unfinished, closes the world of classical poetry. Writing in the fourth century of the Christian era, Claudian has his subject before him in the whole extent of its various development, and also profits by those many pictorial representations of it, which, from the famous picture of Polygnotus downwards, delighted the ancient world. His poem, then, besides having an intrinsic charm, is valuable for some reflexion in it of those lost works, being itself pre-eminently a work in colour, and excelling in a kind of painting in words, which brings its subject very pleasantly almost to the eye of the reader. The mind of this late votary [131] of the old gods, in a world rapidly changing, is crowded with all the beautiful forms generated by mythology, and now about to be forgotten. In this after-glow of Latin literature, lighted up long after their fortune had set, and just before their long night began, they pass before us, in his verses, with the utmost clearness, like the figures in an actual procession. The nursing of the infant Sun and Moon by Tethys; Proserpine and her companions gathering flowers at early dawn, when the violets are drinking in the dew, still lying white upon the grass; the image of Pallas winding the peaceful blossoms about the steel crest of her helmet; the realm of Proserpine, softened somewhat by her coming, and filled with a quiet joy; the matrons of Elysium crowding to her marriage toilet, with the bridal veil of yellow in their hands; the Manes, crowned with ghostly flowers yet warmed a little, at the marriage feast; the ominous dreams of the mother; the desolation of the home, like an empty bird's-nest or an empty fold, when she returns and finds Proserpine gone, and the spider at work over her unfinished embroidery; the strangely-figured raiment, the flowers in the grass, which were once blooming youths, having both their natural colour and the colour of their poetry in them, and the clear little fountain there, which was once the maiden Cyane;--all this is shown in a series of descriptions, like the designs in some unwinding tapestry, like Proserpine's own [132] embroidery, the description of which is the most brilliant of these pictures, and, in its quaint confusion of the images of philosophy with those of mythology, anticipates something of the fancy of the Italian Renaissance. \"Proserpina, filling the house soothingly with her low song, was working a gift against the return of her mother, with labour all to be in vain. In it, she marked out with her needle the houses of the gods and the series of the elements, showing by what law, nature, the parent of all, settled the strife of ancient times, and the seeds of things disparted into their places; the lighter elements are borne aloft, the heavier fall to the centre; the air grows bright with heat, a blazing light whirls round the firmament; the sea flows; the earth hangs suspended in its place. And there were divers colours in it; she illuminated the stars with gold, infused a purple shade into the water, and heightened the shore with gems of flowers; and, under her skilful hand, the threads, with their inwrought lustre, swell up, in momentary counterfeit of the waves; you might think that the sea- wind flapped against the rocks, and that a hollow murmur came creeping over the thirsty sands. She puts in the five zones, marking with a red ground the midmost zone, possessed by burning heat; its outline was parched and stiff; the threads seemed thirsty with the constant sunshine; on either side lay the two zones proper for human life, [133] where a gentle temperance reigns; and at the extremes she drew the twin zones of numbing cold, making her work dun and sad with the hues of perpetual frost. She paints in, too, the sacred places of Dis, her father's brother, and the Manes, so fatal to her; and an omen of her doom was not wanting; for, as she worked, as if with foreknowledge of the future, her face became wet with a sudden burst of tears. And now, in the utmost border of the tissue, she had begun to wind in the wavy line of the river Oceanus, with its glassy shallows; but the door sounds on its hinges, and she perceives the goddesses coming; the unfinished work drops from her hands, and a ruddy blush lights up in her clear and snow-white face.\" I have reserved to the last what is perhaps the daintiest treatment of this subject in classical literature, the account of it which Ovid gives in the Fasti--a kind of Roman Calendar--for the seventh of April, the day of the games of Ceres. He tells over again the old story, with much of which, he says, the reader will be already familiar; but he has something also of his own to add to it, which the reader will hear for the first time; and, like one of those old painters who, in depicting a scene of Christian history, drew from their own fancy or experience its special setting and accessories, he translates the story into something very different from the Homeric hymn. The writer of the Homeric [134] hymn had made Celeus a king, and represented the scene at Eleusis in a fair palace, like the Venetian painters who depict the persons of the Holy Family with royal ornaments. Ovid, on the other hand, is more like certain painters of the early Florentine school, who represent the holy persons amid the more touching circumstances of humble life; and the special something of his own which he adds, is a pathos caught from homely things, not without a delightful, just perceptible, shade of humour even, so rare in such work. All the mysticism has disappeared; but, instead, we trace something of that \"worship of sorrow,\" which has been sometimes supposed to have had no place in classical religious sentiment. In Ovid's well-finished elegiacs, Persephone's flower-gathering, the Anthology, reaches its utmost delicacy; but I give the following episode for the sake of its pathetic expression. \"After many wanderings Ceres was come to Attica. There, in the utmost dejection, for the first time, she sat down to rest on a bare stone, which the people of Attica still call the stone of sorrow. For many days she remained there motionless, under the open sky, heedless of the rain and of the frosty moonlight. Places have their fortunes; and what is now the illustrious town of Eleusis was then the field of an old man named Celeus. He was carrying home a load of acorns, and wild berries shaken down from the [135] brambles, and dry wood for burning on the hearth; his little daughter was leading two goats home from the hills; and at home there was a little boy lying sick in his cradle. 'Mother,' said the little girl--and the goddess was moved at the name of mother--'what do you, all alone, in this solitary place?' The old man stopped too, in spite of his heavy burden, and bade her take shelter in his cottage, though it was but a little one. But at first she refused to come; she looked like an old woman, and an old woman's coif confined her hair; and as the man still urged her, she said to him, 'Heaven bless you; and may children always be yours! My daughter has been stolen from me. Alas! how much happier is your lot than mine'; and, though weeping is impossible for the gods, as she spoke, a bright drop, like a tear, fell into her bosom. Soft-hearted, the little girl and the old man weep together. And after that the good man said, 'Arise! despise not the shelter of my little home; so may the daughter whom you seek be restored to you.' 'Lead me,' answered the goddess; 'you have found out the secret of moving me;' and she arose from the stone, and followed the old man; and as they went he told her of the sick child at home--how he is restless with pain, and cannot sleep. And she, before entering the little cottage, gathered from the untended earth the soothing and sleep-giving poppy; and as she gathered it, it is said that she [136] forgot her vow, and tasted of the seeds, and broke her long fast, unaware. As she came through the door, she saw the house full of trouble, for now there was no more hope of life for the sick boy. She saluted the mother, whose name was Metaneira, and humbly kissed the lips of the child, with her own lips; then the paleness left its face, and suddenly the parents see the strength returning to its body; so great is the force that comes from the divine mouth. And the whole family was full of joy--the mother and the father and the little girl; they were the whole household.* Three profound ethical conceptions, three impressive sacred figures, have now defined themselves for the Greek imagination, condensed from all the traditions which have now been traced, from the hymns of the poets, from the instinctive and unformulated mysticism of primitive minds. Demeter is become the divine sorrowing mother. Kore, the goddess of summer, is become Persephone, the goddess of death, still associated with the forms and odours of flowers and fruit, yet as one risen from the dead also, presenting one side of her ambiguous nature to men's gloomier fancies. Thirdly, there is the image of Demeter enthroned, chastened by sorrow, and somewhat advanced in age, blessing the earth, in her joy at the return of Kore. The myth has [137] now entered on the third phase of its life, in which it becomes the property of those more elevated spirits, who, in the decline of the Greek religion, pick and choose and modify, with perfect freedom of mind, whatever in it may seem adapted to minister to their culture. In this way, the myths of the Greek religion become parts of an ideal, visible embodiments of the susceptibilities and intuitions of the nobler kind of souls; and it is to this latest phase of mythological development that the highest Greek sculpture allies itself. Its function is to give visible aesthetic expression to the constituent parts of that ideal. As poetry dealt chiefly with the incidents of the story, so it is with the personages of the story--with Demeter and Kore themselves--that sculpture has to do. For the myth of Demeter, like the Greek religion in general, had its unlovelier side, grotesque, unhellenic, unglorified by art, illustrated well enough by the description Pausanias gives us of his visit to the cave of the Black Demeter at Phigalia. In his time the image itself had vanished; but he tells us enough about it to enable us to realise its general characteristics, monstrous as the special legend with which it was connected, the black draperies, the horse's head united to the woman's body, with the carved reptiles creeping about it. If, with the thought of this gloomy image of our mother the earth, in our minds, we take up one of those coins [138] which bear the image of Kore or Demeter,* we shall better understand what the function of sculpture really was, in elevating and refining the religious conceptions of the Greeks. Looking on the profile, for instance, on one of those coins of Messene, which almost certainly represent Demeter, and noting the crisp, chaste opening of the lips, the minutely wrought earrings, and the delicately touched ears of corn,--this trifling object being justly regarded as, in its aesthetic qualities, an epitome of art on a larger scale,--we shall see how far the imagination of the Greeks had travelled from what their Black Demeter shows us had once been possible for them, and in making the gods of their worship the objects of a worthy companionship in their thoughts. Certainly, the mind of the old workman who struck that coin was, if we may trust the testimony of his work, unclouded by impure or gloomy shadows. The thought of Demeter is impressed here, with all the purity and proportion, the purged and dainty intelligence of the human countenance. The mystery of it is indeed absent, perhaps could hardly have been looked for in so slight a thing, intended for no sacred purpose, and tossed lightly from hand to hand. But in his firm hold on the harmonies of the human face, the designer of this tranquil head of [139] Demeter is on the one road to a command over the secrets of all imaginative pathos and mystery; though, in the perfect fairness and blitheness of his work, he might seem almost not to have known the incidents of her terrible story. It is probable that, at a later period than in other equally important temples of Greece, the earlier archaic representation of Demeter in the sanctuary of Eleusis, was replaced by a more beautiful image in the new style, with face and hands of ivory, having therefore, in tone and texture, some subtler likeness to women's flesh, and the closely enveloping drapery being constructed in daintily beaten plates of gold. Praxiteles seems to have been the first to bring into the region of a freer artistic handling these shy deities of the earth, shrinking still within the narrow restraints of a hieratic, conventional treatment, long after the more genuine Olympians had broken out of them. The school of Praxiteles, as distinguished from that of Pheidias, is especially the school of grace, relaxing a little the severe ethical tension of the latter, in favour of a slightly Asiatic sinuosity and tenderness. Pausanias tells us that he carved the two goddesses for the temple of Demeter at Athens; and Pliny speaks of two groups of his in brass, the one representing the stealing of Persephone, the other her later, annual descent into Hades, conducted thither by the now pacified mother. All alike have perished; though perhaps some [140] more or less faint reflexion of the most important of these designs may still be traced on many painted vases which depict the stealing of Persephone,--a helpless, plucked flower in the arms of Aidoneus. And in this almost traditional form, the subject was often represented, in low relief, on tombs, some of which still remain; in one or two instances, built up, oddly enough, in the walls of Christian churches. On the tombs of women who had died in early life, this was a favourite subject, some likeness of the actual lineaments of the deceased being sometimes transferred to the features of Persephone. Yet so far, it might seem, when we consider the interest of this story in itself, and its importance in the Greek religion, that no adequate expression of it had remained to us in works of art. But in the year 1857, the discovery of the marbles, in the sacred precinct of Demeter at Cnidus, restored to us an illustration of the myth in its artistic phase, hardly less central than the Homeric hymn in its poetical phase. With the help of the descriptions and plans of Mr. Newton's book,* we can form, as one always wishes to do in such cases, a clear idea of the place where these marbles--three statues of the best style of Greek sculpture, now in the British Museum--were found. Occupying a ledge of rock, looking towards the sea, at the base of a [141] cliff of upheaved limestone, of singular steepness and regularity of surface, the spot presents indications of volcanic disturbance, as if a chasm in the earth had opened here. It was this character, suggesting the belief in an actual connexion with the interior of the earth (local tradition claiming it as the scene of the stealing of Persephone), which probably gave rise, as in other cases where the landscape presented some peculiar feature in harmony with the story, to the dedication upon it of a house and an image of Demeter, with whom were associated Kore and \"the gods with Demeter\"-- hoi theoi para Damatri+--Aidoneus, and the mystical or Chthonian Dionysus. The house seems to have been a small chapel only, of simple construction, and designed for private use, the site itself having been private property, consecrated by a particular family, for their own religious uses, although other persons, servants or dependents of the founders, may also have frequented it. The architecture seems to have been insignificant, but the sculpture costly and exquisite, belonging, if contemporary with the erection of the building, to a great period of Greek art, of which also it is judged to possess intrinsic marks--about the year 350 before Christ, the probable date of the dedication of the little temple. The artists by whom these works were produced were, therefore, either the contemporaries of Praxiteles, whose Venus was for many centuries the glory of [142] Cnidus, or belonged to the generation immediately succeeding him. The temple itself was probably thrown down by a renewal of the volcanic disturbances; the statues however remaining, and the ministers and worshippers still continuing to make shift for their sacred business in the place, now doubly venerable, but with its temple unrestored, down to the second or third century of the Christian era, its frequenters being now perhaps mere chance comers, the family of the original donors having become extinct, or having deserted it. Into this later arrangement, clearly divined by Mr. Newton, through those faint indications which mean much for true experts, the extant remains, as they were found upon the spot, permit us to enter. It is one of the graves of that old religion, but with much still fresh in it. We see it with its provincial superstitions, and its curious magic rites, but also with its means of really solemn impressions, in the culminating forms of Greek art; the two faces of the Greek religion confronting each other here, and the whole having that rare peculiarity of a kind of personal stamp upon it, the place having been designed to meet the fancies of one particular soul, or at least of one family. It is always difficult to bring the every- day aspect of Greek religion home to us; but even the slighter details of this little sanctuary help us to do this; and knowing so little, as we do, of the greater mysteries of [143] Demeter, this glance into an actual religious place dedicated to her, and with the air of her worship still about it, is doubly interesting. The little votive figures of the goddesses, in baked earth, were still lying stored in the small treasury intended for such objects, or scattered about the feet of the images, together with lamps in great number, a lighted lamp being a favourite offering, in memory of the torches with which Demeter sought Persephone, or from some sense of inherent darkness in these gods of the earth; those torches in the hands of Demeter being indeed originally the artificial warmth and brightness of lamp and fire, on winter nights. The dirae or spells,--katadesmoi+- -binding or devoting certain persons to the infernal gods, inscribed on thin rolls of lead, with holes, sometimes, for hanging them up about those quiet statues, still lay, just as they were left, anywhere within the sacred precinct, illustrating at once the gloomier side of the Greek religion in general, and of Demeter and Persephone especially, in their character of avenging deities, and as relics of ancient magic, reproduced so strangely at other times and places, reminding us of the permanence of certain odd ways of human thought. A woman binds with her spell the person who seduces her husband away from her and her children; another, the person who has accused her of preparing poison for her husband; another devotes one who has not restored a borrowed [144] garment, or has stolen a bracelet, or certain drinking-horns; and, from some instances, we might infer that this was a favourite place of worship for the poor and ignorant. In this living picture, we find still lingering on, at the foot of the beautiful Greek marbles, that phase of religious temper which a cynical mind might think a truer link of its unity and permanence than any higher aesthetic instincts--a phase of it, which the art of sculpture, humanising and refining man's conceptions of the unseen, tended constantly to do away. For the higher side of the Greek religion, thus humanised and refined by art, and elevated by it to the sense of beauty, is here also. There were three ideal forms, as we saw, gradually shaping themselves in the development of the story of Demeter, waiting only for complete realisation at the hands of the sculptor; and now, with these forms in our minds, let us place ourselves in thought before the three images which once probably occupied the three niches or ambries in the face of that singular cliff at Cnidus, one of them being then wrought on a larger scale. Of the three figures, one probably represents Persephone, as the goddess of the dead; the second, Demeter enthroned; the third is probably a portrait-statue of a priestess of Demeter, but may perhaps, even so, represent Demeter herself, Demeter Achaea, Ceres Deserta, the mater dolorosa of the Greeks, a type not as yet [145] recognised in any other work of ancient art. Certainly, it seems hard not to believe that this work is in some way connected with the legend of the place to which it belonged, and the main subject of which it realises so completely; and, at least, it shows how the higher Greek sculpture would have worked out this motive. If Demeter at all, it is Demeter the seeker,--Dêô+--as she was called in the mysteries, in some pause of her restless wandering over the world in search of the lost child, and become at last an abstract type of the wanderer. The Homeric hymn, as we saw, had its sculptural motives, the great gestures of Demeter, who was ever the stately goddess, as she followed the daughters of Celeus, or sat by the well-side, or went out and in, through the halls of the palace, expressed in monumental words. With the sentiment of that monumental Homeric presence this statue is penetrated, uniting a certain solemnity of attitude and bearing, to a profound piteousness, an unrivalled pathos of expression. There is something of the pity of Michelangelo's mater dolorosa, in the wasted form and marred countenance, yet with the light breaking faintly over it from the eyes, which, contrary to the usual practice in ancient sculpture, are represented as looking upwards. It is the aged woman who has escaped from pirates, who has but just escaped being sold as a slave, calling on the young for pity. The sorrows of her long wanderings seem to have passed into the marble; [146] and in this too, it meets the demands which the reader of the Homeric hymn, with its command over the resources of human pathos, makes upon the sculptor. The tall figure, in proportion above the ordinary height, is veiled, and clad to the feet in the longer tunic, its numerous folds hanging in heavy parallel lines, opposing the lines of the peplus, or cloak, which cross it diagonally over the breast, enwrapping the upper portion of the body somewhat closely. It is the very type of the wandering woman, going grandly, indeed, as Homer describes her, yet so human in her anguish, that we seem to recognise some far descended shadow of her, in the homely figure of the roughly clad French peasant woman, who, in one of Corot's pictures, is hasting along under a sad light, as the day goes out behind the little hill. We have watched the growth of the merely personal sentiment in the story; and we may notice that, if this figure be indeed Demeter, then the conception of her has become wholly humanised; no trace of the primitive cosmical import of the myth, no colour or scent of the mystical earth, remains about it. The seated figure, much mutilated, and worn by long exposure, yet possessing, according to the best critics, marks of the school of Praxiteles, is almost undoubtedly the image of Demeter enthroned. Three times in the Homeric hymn she is represented as sitting, once by the fountain at the wayside, again in the house of Celeus, and [147] again in the newly finished temple of Eleusis; but always in sorrow; seated on the petra agelastos,+ which, as Ovid told us, the people of Attica still called the stone of sorrow. Here she is represented in her later state of reconciliation, enthroned as the glorified mother of all things. The delicate plaiting of the tunic about the throat, the formal curling of the hair, and a certain weight of over-thoughtfulness in the brows, recall the manner of Leonardo da Vinci, a master, one of whose characteristics is a very sensitive expression of the sentiment of maternity. It reminds one especially of a work by one of his scholars, the Virgin of the Balances, in the Louvre, a picture which has been thought to represent, under a veil, the blessing of universal nature, and in which the sleepy-looking heads, with a peculiar grace and refinement of somewhat advanced life in them, have just this half-weary posture. We see here, then, the Here of the world below, the Stygian Juno, the chief of those Elysian matrons who come crowding, in the poem of Claudian, to the marriage toilet of Proserpine, the goddess of the fertility of the earth and of all creatures, but still of fertility as arisen out of death;* and therefore she is not without a certain pensiveness, having seen the seed fall into the ground and die, many times. Persephone is returned to her, and the hair [148] spreads, like a rich harvest, over her shoulders; but she is still veiled, and knows that the seed must fall into the ground again, and Persephone descend again from her. The statues of the supposed priestess, and of the enthroned Demeter, are of more than the size of life; the figure of Persephone is but seventeen inches high, a daintily handled toy of Parian marble, the miniature copy perhaps of a much larger work, which might well be reproduced on a magnified scale. The conception of Demeter is throughout chiefly human, and even domestic, though never without a hieratic interest, because she is not a goddess only, but also a priestess. In contrast, Persephone is wholly unearthly, the close companion, and even the confused double, of Hecate, the goddess of midnight terrors,--Despoena,--the final mistress of all that lives; and as sorrow is the characteristic sentiment of Demeter, so awe of Persephone. She is compact of sleep, and death, and flowers, but of narcotic flowers especially,--a revenant, who in the garden of Aidoneus has eaten of the pomegranate, and bears always the secret of decay in her, of return to the grave, in the mystery of those swallowed seeds; sometimes, in later work, holding in her hand the key of the great prison-house, but which unlocks all secrets also; (there, finally, or through oracles revealed in dreams;) sometimes, like Demeter, the poppy, emblem of sleep and death by its [149] narcotic juices, of life and resurrection by its innumerable seeds, of the dreams, therefore, that may intervene between falling asleep and waking. Treated as it is in the Homeric hymn, and still more in this statue, the image of Persephone may be regarded as the result of many efforts to lift the old Chthonian gloom, still lingering on in heavier souls, concerning the grave, to connect it with impressions of dignity and beauty, and a certain sweetness even; it is meant to make men in love, or at least at peace, with death. The Persephone of Praxiteles' school, then, is Aphrodite-Persephone, Venus-Libitina. Her shadowy eyes have gazed upon the fainter colouring of the under- world, and the tranquillity, born of it, has \"passed into her face\"; for the Greek Hades is, after all, but a quiet, twilight place, not very different from that House of Fame where Dante places the great souls of the classical world; Aidoneus himself being conceived, in the highest Greek sculpture, as but a gentler Zeus, the great innkeeper; so that when a certain Greek sculptor had failed in his portraiture of Zeus, because it had too little hilarity, too little, in the eyes and brow, of the open and cheerful sky, he only changed its title, and the thing passed excellently, with its heavy locks and shadowy eyebrows, for the god of the dead. The image of Persephone, then, as it is here composed, with the tall, tower-like head-dress, from which the veil depends--the corn-basket, [150] originally carried thus by the Greek women, balanced on the head--giving the figure unusual length, has the air of a body bound about with grave- clothes; while the archaic hands and feet, and a certain stiffness in the folds of the drapery, give it something of a hieratic character, and to the modern observer may suggest a sort of kinship with the more chastened kind of Gothic work. But quite of the school of Praxiteles is the general character of the composition; the graceful waving of the hair, the fine shadows of the little face, of the eyes and lips especially, like the shadows of a flower--a flower risen noiselessly from its dwelling in the dust--though still with that fulness or heaviness in the brow, as of sleepy people, which, in the delicate gradations of Greek sculpture, distinguish the infernal deities from their Olympian kindred. The object placed in the hand may be, perhaps, a stiff, archaic flower, but is probably the partly consumed pomegranate--one morsel gone; the most usual emblem of Persephone being this mystical fruit, which, because of the multitude of its seeds, was to the Romans a symbol of fecundity, and was sold at the doors of the temple of Ceres, that the women might offer it there, and bear numerous children; and so, to the middle age, became a symbol of the fruitful earth itself; and then of that other seed sown in the dark under-world; and at last of that whole hidden region, so thickly sown, which Dante visited, Michelino painting him, [151] in the Duomo of Florence, with this fruit in his hand, and Botticelli putting it into the childish hands of Him, who, if men \"go down into hell, is there also.\" There is an attractiveness in these goddesses of the earth, akin to the influence of cool places, quiet houses, subdued light, tranquillising voices. What is there in this phase of ancient religion for us, at the present day? The myth of Demeter and Persephone, then, illustrates the power of the Greek religion as a religion of pure ideas--of conceptions, which having no link on historical fact, yet, because they arose naturally out of the spirit of man, and embodied, in adequate symbols, his deepest thoughts concerning the conditions of his physical and spiritual life, maintained their hold through many changes, and are still not without a solemnising power even for the modern mind, which has once admitted them as recognised and habitual inhabitants; and, abiding thus for the elevation and purifying of our sentiments, long after the earlier and simpler races of their worshippers have passed away, they may be a pledge to us of the place in our culture, at once legitimate and possible, of the associations, the conceptions, the imagery, of Greek religious poetry in general, of the poetry of all religions.

HIPPOLYTUS VEILED: A STUDY FROM EURIPIDES [152] CENTURIES of zealous archaeology notwithstanding, many phases of the so varied Greek genius are recorded for the modern student in a kind of shorthand only, or not at all. Even for Pausanias, visiting Greece before its direct part in affairs was quite played out, much had perished or grown dim--of its art, of the truth of its outward history, above all of its religion as a credible or practicable thing. And yet Pausanias visits Greece under conditions as favourable for observation as those under which later travellers, Addison or Eustace, proceed to Italy. For him the impress of life in those old Greek cities is not less vivid and entire than that of medieval Italy to ourselves; at Siena, for instance, with its ancient palaces still in occupation, its public edifices as serviceable as if the old republic had but just now vacated them, the tradition of their primitive worship still unbroken in its churches. Had the opportunities in which Pausanias was [153] fortunate been ours, how many haunts of the antique Greek life unnoticed by him we should have peeped into, minutely systematic in our painstaking! how many a view would broaden out where he notes hardly anything at all on his map of Greece! One of the most curious phases of Greek civilisation which has thus perished for us, and regarding which, as we may fancy, we should have made better use of that old traveller's facilities, is the early Attic deme-life--its picturesque, intensely localised variety, in the hollow or on the spur of mountain or sea-shore; and with it many a relic of primitive religion, many an early growth of art parallel to what Vasari records of artistic beginnings in the smaller cities of Italy. Colonus and Acharnae, surviving still so vividly by the magic of Sophocles, of Aristophanes, are but isolated examples of a widespread manner of life, in which, amid many provincial peculiarities, the first, yet perhaps the most costly and telling steps were made in all the various departments of Greek culture. Even in the days of Pausanias, Piraeus was still traceable as a distinct township, once the possible rival of Athens, with its little old covered market by the seaside, and the symbolical picture of the place, its Genius, visible on the wall. And that is but the type of what there had been to know of threescore and more village communities, each having its own altars, its special worship and [154] place of civic assembly, its trade and crafts, its name drawn from physical peculiarity or famous incident, its body of heroic tradition. Lingering on while Athens, the great deme, gradually absorbed into itself more and more of their achievements, and passing away almost completely as political factors in the Peloponnesian war, they were still felt, we can hardly doubt, in the actual physiognomy of Greece. That variety in unity, which its singular geographical formation secured to Greece as a whole, was at its utmost in these minute reflexions of the national character, with all the relish of local difference--new art, new poetry, fresh ventures in political combination, in the conception of life, springing as if straight from the soil, like the thorn-blossom of early spring in magic lines over all that rocky land. On the other hand, it was just here that ancient habits clung most tenaciously--that old-fashioned, homely, delightful existence, to which the refugee, pent up in Athens in the years of the Peloponnesian war, looked back so fondly. If the impression of Greece generally is but enhanced by the littleness of the physical scene of events intellectually so great--such a system of grand lines, restrained within so narrow a compass, as in one of its fine coins--still more would this be true of those centres of country life. Here, certainly, was that assertion of seemingly small interests, which brings into free play, and gives his utmost value [155] to, the individual; making his warfare, equally with his more peaceful rivalries, deme against deme, the mountain against the plain, the sea-shore, (as in our own old Border life, but played out here by wonderfully gifted people) tangible as a personal history, to the doubling of its fascination for those whose business is with the survey of the dramatic side of life. As with civil matters, so it was also, we may fairly suppose, with religion; the deme-life was a manifestation of religious custom and sentiment, in all their primitive local variety. As Athens, gradually drawing into itself the various elements of provincial culture, developed, with authority, the central religious position, the demes-men did but add the worship of Athene Polias, the goddess of the capital, to their own pre-existent ritual uses. Of local and central religion alike, time and circumstance had obliterated much when Pausanias came. A devout spirit, with religion for his chief interest, eager for the trace of a divine footstep, anxious even in the days of Lucian to deal seriously with what had counted for so much to serious men, he has, indeed, to lament that \"Pan is dead\":-- \"They come no longer!\"--\"These things happen no longer!\" But the Greek--his very name also, Hellen, was the title of a priesthood--had been religious abundantly, sanctifying every detail of his actual life with the religious idea; and as Pausanias goes on his way he finds many a remnant of that [156] earlier estate of religion, when, as he fancied, it had been nearer the gods, as it was certainly nearer the earth. It is marked, even in decay, with varieties of place; and is not only continuous but in situ. At Phigaleia he makes his offerings to Demeter, agreeably to the paternal rites of the inhabitants, wax, fruit, undressed wool \"still full of the sordes of the sheep.\" A dream from heaven cuts short his notice of the mysteries of Eleusis. He sees the stone, \"big enough for a little man,\" on which Silenus was used to sit and rest; at Athens, the tombs of the Amazons, of the purple-haired Nisus, of Deucalion;--\"it is a manifest token that he had dwelt there.\" The worshippers of Poseidon, even at his temple among the hills, might still feel the earth fluctuating beneath their feet. And in care for divine things, he tells us, the Athenians outdid all other Greeks. Even in the days of Nero it revealed itself oddly; and it is natural to suppose that of this temper the demes, as the proper home of conservatism, were exceptionally expressive. Scattered in those remote, romantic villages, among their olives or sea-weeds, lay the heroic graves, the relics, the sacred images, often rude enough amid the delicate tribute of later art; this too oftentimes finding in such retirement its best inspirations, as in some Attic Fiesole. Like a network over the land of gracious poetic tradition, as also of undisturbed ceremonial usage surviving late for those who cared to seek it, the [157] local religions had been never wholly superseded by the worship of the great national temples. They were, in truth, the most characteristic developments of a faith essentially earth-born or indigenous. And how often must the student of fine art, again, wish he had the same sort of knowledge about its earlier growth in Greece, that he actually possesses in the case of Italian art! Given any development at all in this matter, there must have been phases of art, which, if immature, were also veritable expressions of power to come, intermediate discoveries of beauty, such as are by no means a mere anticipation, and of service only as explaining historically larger subsequent achievements, but of permanent attractiveness in themselves, being often, indeed, the true maturity of certain amiable artistic qualities. And in regard to Greek art at its best--the Parthenon--no less than to the art of the Renaissance at its best-- the Sistine Chapel--the more instructive light would be derived rather from what precedes than what follows such central success, from the determination to apprehend the fulfilment of past effort rather than the eve of decline, in the critical, central moment which partakes of both. Of such early promise, early achievement, we have in the case of Greek art little to compare with what is extant of the youth of the arts in Italy. Overbeck's careful gleanings of its history form indeed [158] a sorry relic as contrasted with Vasari's intimations of the beginnings of the Renaissance. Fired by certain fragments of its earlier days, of a beauty, in truth, absolute, and vainly longing for more, the student of Greek sculpture indulges the thought of an ideal of youthful energy therein, yet withal of youthful self-restraint; and again, as with survivals of old religion, the privileged home, he fancies, of that ideal must have been in those venerable Attic townships, as to a large extent it passed away with them. The budding of new art, the survival of old religion, at isolated centres of provincial life, where varieties of human character also were keen, abundant, asserted in correspondingly effective incident-- this is what irresistible fancy superinduces on historic details, themselves meagre enough. The sentiment of antiquity is indeed a characteristic of all cultivated people, even in what may seem the freshest ages, and not exclusively a humour of our later world. In the earliest notices about them, as we know, the people of Attica appear already impressed by the immense antiquity of their occupation of its soil, of which they claim to be the very first flower. Some at least of those old demes-men we may well fancy sentimentally reluctant to change their habits, fearful of losing too much of themselves in the larger stream of life, clinging to what is antiquated as the work of centralisation goes on, needful as that work was, [159] with the great \"Eastern difficulty\" already ever in the distance. The fear of Asia, barbaric, splendid, hardly known, yet haunting the curious imagination of those who had borrowed thence the art in which they were rapidly excelling it, developing, as we now see, in the interest of Greek humanity, crafts begotten of tyrannic and illiberal luxury, was finally to suppress the rivalries of those primitive centres of activity, when the \"invincible armada\" of the common foe came into sight. At a later period civil strife was to destroy their last traces. The old hoplite, from Rhamnus or Acharnae, pent up in beleaguered Athens during that first summer of the Peloponnesian war, occupying with his household a turret of the wall, as Thucydides describes--one of many picturesque touches in that severe historian--could well remember the ancient provincial life which this conflict with Sparta was bringing to an end. He could recall his boyish, half-scared curiosity concerning those Persian ships, coming first as merchantmen, or with pirates on occasion, in the half-savage, wicked splendours of their decoration, the monstrous figure-heads, their glittering freightage. Men would hardly have trusted their women or children with that suspicious crew, hovering through the dusk. There were soothsayers, indeed, who had long foretold what happened soon after, giving shape to vague, supernatural terrors. And then he had crept [160] from his hiding-place with other lads to go view the enemies' slain at Marathon, beside those belated Spartans, this new war with whom seemed to be reviving the fierce local feuds of his younger days. Paraloi and Diacrioi had ever been rivals. Very distant it all seemed now, with all the stories he could tell; for in those crumbling little towns, as heroic life had lingered on into the actual, so, at an earlier date, the supernatural into the heroic. Like mist at dawn, the last traces of its divine visitors had then vanished from the land, where, however, they had already begotten \"our best and oldest families.\" It was Theseus, uncompromising young master of the situation, in fearless application of \"the modern spirit\" of his day to every phase of life where it was applicable, who, at the expense of Attica, had given Athens a people, reluctant enough, in truth, as Plutarch suggests, to desert \"their homes and religious usages and many good and gracious kings of their own\" for this elect youth, who thus figures, passably, as a kind of mythic shorthand for civilisation, making roads and the like, facilitating travel, suppressing various forms of violence, but many innocent things as well. So it must needs be in a world where, even hand in hand with a god-assisted hero, Justice goes blindfold. He slays the bull of Marathon and many another local tyrant, but also exterminates that delightful creature, the Centaur. The Amazon, whom Plato will [161] reinstate as the type of improved womanhood, has no better luck than Phaea, the sow-pig of Crommyon, foul old landed-proprietress. They exerted, however, the prerogative of poetic protest, and survive thereby. Centaur and Amazon, as we see them in the fine art of Greece, represent the regret of Athenians themselves for something that could never be brought to life again, and have their pathos. Those young heroes contending with Amazons on the frieze of the Mausoleum had best make haste with their bloody work, if young people's eyes can tell a true story. A type still of progress triumphant through injustice, set on improving things off the face of the earth, Theseus took occasion to attack the Amazons in their mountain home, not long after their ruinous conflict with Hercules, and hit them when they were down. That greater bully had laboured off on the world's highway, carrying with him the official girdle of Antiope, their queen, gift of Ares, and therewith, it would seem, the mystic secret of their strength. At sight of this new foe, at any rate, she came to a strange submission. The savage virgin had turned to very woman, and was presently a willing slave, returning on the gaily appointed ship in all haste to Athens, where in supposed wedlock she bore King Theseus a son. With their annual visit--visit to the Gargareans!--for the purpose of maintaining their [162] species, parting with their boys early, these husbandless women could hardly be supposed a very happy, certainly not a very joyous people. They figure rather as a sorry measure of the luck of the female sex in taking a hard natural law into their own hands, and by abnegation of all tender companionship making shift with bare independence, as a kind of second-best--the best practicable by them in the imperfect actual condition of things. But the heart-strings would ache still where the breast had been cut away. The sisters of Antiope had come, not immediately, but in careful array of battle, to bring back the captive. All along the weary roads from the Caucasus to Attica, their traces had remained in the great graves of those who died by the way. Against the little remnant, carrying on the fight to the very midst of Athens, Antiope herself had turned, all other thoughts transformed now into wild idolatry of her hero. Superstitious, or in real regret, the Athenians never forgot their tombs. As for Antiope, the conscience of her perfidy remained with her, adding the pang of remorse to her own desertion, when King Theseus, with his accustomed bad faith to women, set her, too, aside in turn. Phaedra, the true wife, was there, peeping suspiciously at her arrival; and even as Antiope yielded to her lord's embraces the thought had come that a male child might be the instrument of her anger, and one day judge her cause. [163] In one of these doomed, decaying villages, then, King Theseus placed the woman and her babe, hidden, yet secure, within the Attic border, as men veil their mistakes or crimes. They might pass away, they and their story, together with the memory of other antiquated creatures of such places, who had had connubial dealings with the stars. The white, paved waggon-track, a by-path of the sacred way to Eleusis, zigzagged through sloping olive-yards, from the plain of silvered blue, with Athens building in the distance, and passed the door of the rude stone house, furnished scantily, which no one had ventured to inhabit of late years till they came there. On the ledges of the grey cliffs above, the laurel groves, stem and foliage of motionless bronze, had spread their tents. Travellers bound northwards were glad to repose themselves there, and take directions, or provision for their journey onwards, from the highland people, who came down hither to sell their honey, their cheese, and woollen stuff, in the tiny market-place. At dawn the great stars seemed to halt a while, burning as if for sacrifice to some pure deity, on those distant, obscurely named heights, like broken swords, the rim of the world. A little later you could just see the newly opened quarries, like streaks of snow on their russet-brown bosoms. Thither in spring-time all eyes turned from Athens devoutly, intent till the first shaft of lightning gave signal for the departure of the [164] sacred ship to Delos. Racing over those rocky surfaces, the virgin air descended hither with the secret of profound sleep, as the child lay in its cubicle hewn in the stone, the white fleeces heaped warmly round him. In the wild Amazon's soul, to her surprise, and at first against her will, the maternal sense had quickened from the moment of his conception, and (that burst of angry tears with which she had received him into the world once dried up), kindling more eagerly at every token of manly growth, had at length driven out every other feeling. And this animal sentiment, educating the human hand and heart in her, had become a moral one, when, King Theseus leaving her in anger, visibly unkind, the child had crept to her side, and tracing with small fingers the wrinkled lines of her woebegone brow, carved there as if by a thousand years of sorrow, had sown between himself and her the seed of an undying sympathy. She was thus already on the watch for a host of minute recognitions on his part, of the self-sacrifice involved in her devotion to a career of which she must needs drain out the sorrow, careful that he might taste only the joy. So far, amid their spare living, the child, as if looking up to the warm broad wing of her love above him, seemed replete with comfort. Yet in his moments of childish sickness, the first passing shadows upon the deep joy of her motherhood, she teaches him betimes to soothe [165] or cheat pain-- little bodily pains only, hitherto. She ventures sadly to assure him of the harsh necessities of life: \"Courage, child! Every one must take his share of suffering. Shift not thy body so vehemently. Pain, taken quietly, is easier to bear.\" Carefully inverting the habits of her own rude childhood, she learned to spin the wools, white and grey, to clothe and cover him pleasantly. The spectacle of his unsuspicious happiness, though at present a matter of purely physical conditions, awoke a strange sense of poetry, a kind of artistic sense in her, watching, as her own long-deferred recreation in life, his delight in the little delicacies she prepared to his liking--broiled kids' flesh, the red wine, the mushrooms sought through the early dew--his hunger and thirst so daintily satisfied, as he sat at table, like the first-born of King Theseus, with two wax-lights and a fire at dawn or nightfall dancing to the prattle and laughter, a bright child, never stupidly weary. At times his very happiness would seem to her like a menace of misfortune to come. Was there not with herself the curse of that unsisterly action? and not far from him, the terrible danger of the father's, the step-mother's jealousy, the mockery of those half- brothers to come? Ah! how perilous for happiness the sensibilities which make him so exquisitely happy now! Before they started on their dreadful visit to the Minotaur, says Plutarch, the women told their [166] sons many tales and other things to encourage them; and, even as she had furnished the child betimes with rules for the solace of bodily pain, so now she would have brought her own sad experience into service in precepts for the ejection of its festering power out of any other trouble that might visit him. Already those little disappointments which are as the shadow beside all conscious enjoyment, were no petty things to her, but had for her their pathos, as children's troubles will have, in spite of the longer chance before them. They were as the first steps in a long story of deferred hopes, or anticipations of death itself and the end of them. The gift of Ares gone, the mystic girdle she would fain have transferred to the child, that bloody god of storm and battle, hereditary patron of her house, faded from her thoughts together with the memory of her past life--the more completely, because another familiar though somewhat forbidding deity, accepting certainly a cruel and forbidding worship, was already in possession, and reigning in the new home when she came thither. Only, thanks to some kindly local influence (by grace, say, of its delicate air), Artemis, this other god she had known in the Scythian wilds, had put aside her fierce ways, as she paused awhile on her heavenly course among these ancient abodes of men, gliding softly, mainly through their dreams, with abundance of salutary touches. Full, in truth, of [167] grateful memory of some timely service at human hands! In these highland villages the tradition of celestial visitants clung fondly, of god or hero, belated or misled on long journeys, yet pleased to be among the sons of men, as their way led them up the steep, narrow, crooked street, condescending to rest a little, as one, under some sudden stress not clearly ascertained, had done here, in this very house, thereafter for ever sacred. The place and its inhabitants, of course, had been something bigger in the days of those old mythic hospitalities, unless, indeed, divine persons took kindly the will for the deed--very different, surely, from the present condition of things, for there was little here to detain a delicate traveller, even in the abode of Antiope and her son, though it had been the residence of a king. Hard by stood the chapel of the goddess, who had thus adorned the place with her memories. The priests, indeed, were already departed to Athens, carrying with them the ancient image, the vehicle of her actual presence, as the surest means of enriching the capital at the expense of the country, where she must now make poor shift of the occasional worshipper on his way through these mountain passes. But safely roofed beneath the sturdy tiles of grey Hymettus marble, upon the walls of the little square recess enclosing the deserted pedestal, a series of crowded imageries, in the devout spirit [168] of earlier days, were eloquent concerning her. Here from scene to scene, touched with silver among the wild and human creatures in dun bronze, with the moon's disk around her head, shrouded closely, the goddess of the chase still glided mystically through all the varied incidents of her story, in all the detail of a written book. A book for the delighted reading of a scholar, willing to ponder at leisure, to make his way surely, and understand. Very different, certainly, from the cruel-featured little idol his mother had brought in her bundle--the old Scythian Artemis, hanging there on the wall, side by side with the forgotten Ares, blood-red,--the goddess reveals herself to the lad, poring through the dusk by taper-light, as at once a virgin, necessarily therefore the creature of solitude, yet also as the assiduous nurse of children, and patroness of the young. Her friendly intervention at the act of birth everywhere, her claim upon the nursling, among tame and wild creatures equally, among men as among gods, nay! among the stars (upon the very star of dawn), gave her a breadth of influence seemingly coextensive with the sum of things. Yes! his great mother was in touch with everything. Yet throughout he can but note her perpetual chastity, with pleasurable though half-suspicious wonder at the mystery, he knows not what, involved therein, as though he awoke suddenly in some distant, unexplored region of her person and activity. [169] Why the lighted torch always, and that long straight vesture rolled round so formally? Was it only against the cold of these northern heights? To her, nevertheless, her maternity, her solitude, to this virgin mother, who, with no husband, no lover, no fruit of her own, is so tender to the children of others, in a full heart he devotes himself- -his immaculate body and soul. Dedicating himself thus, he has the sense also that he becomes more entirely than ever the chevalier of his mortal mother, of her sad cause. The devout, diligent hands clear away carefully the dust, the faded relics of her former worship; a worship renewed once more as the sacred spring, set free from encumbrance, in answer to his willing ministries murmurs again under the dim vault in its marble basin, work of primitive Titanic fingers--flows out through its rocky channel, filling the whole township with chaste thoughts of her. Through much labour at length he comes to the veritable story of her birth, like a gift direct from the goddess herself to this loyal soul. There were those in later times who, like Aeschylus, knew Artemis as the daughter not of Leto but of Demeter, according to the version of her history now conveyed to the young Hippolytus, together with some deepened insight into her character. The goddess of Eleusis, on a journey, in the old days when, as Plato says, [170] men lived nearer the gods, finding herself with child by some starry inmate of those high places, had lain down in the rock-hewn cubicle of the inner chamber, and, certainly in sorrow, brought forth a daughter. Here was the secret at once of the genial, all-embracing maternity of this new strange Artemis, and of those more dubious tokens, the lighted torch, the winding-sheet, the arrow of death on the string--of sudden death, truly, which may be thought after all the kindest, as prevenient of all disgraceful sickness or waste in the unsullied limbs. For the late birth into the world of this so shadowy daughter was somehow identified with the sudden passing into Hades of her first-born, Persephone. As he scans those scenes anew, an awful surmise comes to him; his divine patroness moves there as death, surely. Still, however, gratefully putting away suspicion, he seized even in these ambiguous imageries their happier suggestions, satisfied in thinking of his new mother as but the giver of sound sleep, of the benign night, whence--mystery of mysteries!--good things are born softly, from which he awakes betimes for his healthful service to her. Either way, sister of Apollo or sister of Persephone, to him she should be a power of sanity, sweet as the flowers he offered her gathered at dawn, setting daily their purple and white frost against her ancient marbles. There was more certainly than the first breath of day in them. Was there [171] here something of her person, her sensible presence, by way of direct response to him in his early devotion, astir for her sake before the very birds, nesting here so freely, the quail above all, in some privileged connexion with her story still unfathomed by the learned youth? Amid them he too found a voice, and sang articulately the praises of the great goddess. Those more dubious traits, nevertheless, so lightly disposed of by Hippolytus (Hecate thus counting for him as Artemis goddess of health), became to his mother, in the light of her sad experience, the sum of the whole matter. While he drew only peaceful inducements to sleep from that two-sided figure, she reads there a volume of sinister intentions, and liked little this seemingly dead goddess, who could but move among the living banefully, stealing with her night-shade into the day where she had no proper right. The gods had ever had much to do with the shaping of her fortunes and the fortunes of her kindred; and the mortal mother felt nothing less than jealousy from the hour when the lad had first delightedly called her to share his discoveries, and learn the true story (if it were not rather the malicious counterfeit) of the new divine mother to whom he has thus absolutely entrusted himself. Was not this absolute chastity itself a kind of death? She, too, in secret makes her gruesome midnight offering with averted eyes. She dreams one night he is in danger; creeps to his cubicle [172] to see; the face is covered, as he lies, against the cold. She traces the motionless outline, raises the coverlet; with the nice black head deep in the fleecy pillow he is sleeping quietly, he dreams of that other mother gliding in upon the moonbeam, and awaking turns sympathetically upon the living woman, is subdued in a moment to the expression of her troubled spirit, and understands. And when the child departed from her for the first time, springing from his white bed before the dawn, to accompany the elders on their annual visit to the Eleusinian goddess, the after-sense of his wonderful happiness, tranquillising her in spite of herself by its genial power over the actual moment, stirred nevertheless a new sort of anxiety for the future. Her work in life henceforward was defined as a ministry to so precious a gift, in full consciousness of its risk; it became her religion, the centre of her pieties. She missed painfully his continual singing hovering about the place, like the earth itself made audible in all its humanities. Half-selfish for a moment, she prays that he may remain for ever a child, to her solace; welcomes now the promise of his chastity (though chastity were itself a kind of death) as the pledge of his abiding always with her. And these thoughts were but infixed more deeply by the sudden stroke of joy at his return home in ceremonial trim and grown more manly, with much increase of self-confidence in that brief absence among his fellows. [173] For, from the first, the unwelcome child, the outcast, had been successful, with that special good fortune which sometimes attends the outcast. His happiness, his invincible happiness, had been found engaging, perhaps by the gods, certainly by men; and when King Theseus came to take note how things went in that rough life he had assigned them, he felt a half liking for the boy, and bade him come down to Athens and see the sights, partly by way of proof to his already somewhat exacting wife of the difference between the old love and the new as measured by the present condition of their respective offspring. The fine nature, fastidious by instinct, but bred with frugality enough to find the charm of continual surprise in that delicate new Athens, draws, as he goes, the full savour of its novelties; the marbles, the space and finish, the busy gaiety of its streets, the elegance of life there, contrasting with while it adds some mysterious endearment to the thought of his own rude home. Without envy, in hope only one day to share, to win them by kindness, he gazes on the motley garden-plots, the soft bedding, the showy toys, the delicate keep of the children of Phaedra, who turn curiously to their half-brother, venture to touch his long strange gown of homespun grey, like the soft coat of some wild creature who might let one stroke it. Close to their dainty existence for a while, he regards it as from afar; looks forward all day to the lights, the prattle, the laughter, the white [174] bread, like sweet cake to him, of their ordinary evening meal; returns again and again, in spite of himself, to watch, to admire, feeling a power within him to merit the like; finds his way back at last, still light of heart, to his own poor fare, able to do without what he would enjoy so much. As, grateful for his scanty part in things--for the make-believe of a feast in the little white loaves she too has managed to come by, sipping the thin white wine, he touches her dearly, the mother is shocked with a sense of something unearthly in his contentment, while he comes and goes, singing now more abundantly than ever a new canticle to her divine rival. Were things, after all, to go grudgingly with him? Sensible of that curse on herself, with her suspicions of his kinsfolk, of this dubious goddess to whom he has devoted himself, she anticipates with more foreboding than ever his path to be, with or without a wife--her own solitude, or his--the painful heats and cold. She fears even these late successes; it were best to veil their heads. The strong as such had ever been against her and hers. The father came again; noted the boy's growth. Manliest of men, like Hercules in his cloak of lion's skin, he has after all but scant liking, feels, through a certain meanness of soul, scorn for the finer likeness of himself. Might this creature of an already vanishing world, who for all his hard rearing had a manifest distinction of character, one day become his rival, full of [175] loyalty as he was already to the deserted mother? To charming Athens, nevertheless, he crept back, as occasion served, to gaze peacefully on the delightful good fortune of others, waiting for the opportunity to take his own turn with the rest, driving down thither at last in a chariot gallantly, when all the town was assembled to celebrate the king's birthday. For the goddess, herself turning ever kinder, and figuring more and more exclusively as the tender nurse of all things, had transformed her young votary from a hunter into a charioteer, a rearer and driver of horses, after the fashion of his Amazon mothers before him. Thereupon, all the lad's wholesome vanity had centered on the fancy of the world-famous games then lately established, as, smiling down his mother's terrors, and grateful to his celestial mother for many a hair-breadth escape, he practised day by day, fed the animals, drove them out, amused though companionless, visited them affectionately in the deserted stone stables of the ancient king. A chariot and horses, as being the showiest outward thing the world afforded, was like the pawn he moved to represent the big demand he meant to make, honestly, generously, on the ample fortunes of life. There was something of his old miraculous kindred, alien from this busy new world he came to, about the boyish driver with the fame of a scholar, in his grey fleecy cloak and hood of soft [175] white woollen stuff, as he drove in that morning. Men seemed to have seen a star flashing, and crowded round to examine the little mountain-bred beasts, in loud, friendly intercourse with the hero of the hour--even those usually somewhat unsympathetic half-brothers now full of enthusiasm for the outcast and his good fight for prosperity. Instinctively people admired his wonderful placidity, and would fain have shared its secret, as it were the carelessness of some fair flower upon his face. A victor in the day's race, he carried home as his prize a glittering new harness in place of the very old one he had come with. \"My chariot and horses!\" he says now, with his single touch of pride. Yet at home, savouring to the full his old solitary happiness, veiled again from time to time in that ancient life, he is still the student, still ponders the old writings which tell of his divine patroness. At Athens strange stories are told in turn of him, his nights upon the mountains, his dreamy sin, with that hypocritical virgin goddess, stories which set the jealous suspicions of Theseus at rest once more. For so \"dream\" not those who have the tangible, appraisable world in view. Even Queen Phaedra looks with pleasure, as he comes, on the once despised illegitimate creature, at home now here too, singing always audaciously, so visibly happy, occupied, popular. Encompassed by the luxuries of Athens, far from those peaceful mountain places, among people [177] further still in spirit from their peaceful light and shade, he did not forget the kindly goddess, still sharing with his earthly mother the prizes, or what they would buy, for the adornment of their spare abode. The tombs of the fallen Amazons, the spot where they had breathed their last, he piously visited, informed himself of every circumstance of the event with devout care, and, thinking on them amid the dainties of the royal table, boldly brought them too their share of the offerings to the heroic dead. Aphrodite, indeed--Aphrodite, of whom he had scarcely so much as heard--was just then the best-served deity in Athens, with all its new wealth of colour and form, its gold and ivory, the acting, the music, the fantastic women, beneath the shadow of the great walls still rising steadily. Hippolytus would have no part in her worship; instead did what was in him to revive the neglected service of his own goddess, stirring an old jealousy. For Aphrodite too had looked with delight upon the youth, already the centre of a hundred less dangerous human rivalries among the maidens of Greece, and was by no means indifferent to his indifference, his instinctive distaste; while the sterner, almost forgotten Artemis found once more her great moon-shaped cake, set about with starry tapers, at the appointed seasons. They know him now from afar, by his emphatic, shooting, arrowy movements; and on [178] the day of the great chariot races \"he goes in and wins.\" To the surprise of all he compounded his handsome prize for the old wooden image taken from the chapel at home, lurking now in an obscure shrine in the meanest quarter of the town. Sober amid the noisy feasting which followed, unashamed, but travelling by night to hide it from their mockery, warm at his bosom, he reached the passes at twilight, and through the deep peace of the glens bore it to the old resting-place, now more worthy than ever of the presence of its mistress, his mother and all the people of the village coming forth to salute her, all doors set mystically open, as she advances. Phaedra too, his step-mother, a fiery soul with wild strange blood in her veins, forgetting her fears of this illegitimate rival of her children, seemed now to have seen him for the first time, loved at last the very touch of his fleecy cloak, and would fain have had him of her own religion. As though the once neglected child had been another, she tries to win him as a stranger in his manly perfection, growing more than an affectionate mother to her husband's son. But why thus intimate and congenial, she asks, always in the wrong quarter? Why not compass two ends at once? Why so squeamishly neglect the powerful, any power at all, in a city so full of religion? He might find the image of her sprightly goddess everywhere, to his [179] liking, gold, silver, native or stranger, new or old, graceful, or indeed, if he preferred it so, in iron or stone. By the way, she explains the delights of love, of marriage, the husband once out of the way; finds in him, with misgiving, a sort of forwardness, as she thinks, on this one matter, as if he understood her craft and despised it. He met her questions in truth with scarce so much as contempt, with laughing counter-queries, why people needed wedding at all? They might have found the children in the temples, or bought them, as you could buy flowers in Athens. Meantime Phaedra's young children draw from the seemingly unconscious finger the marriage-ring, set it spinning on the floor at his feet, and the staid youth places it for a moment on his own finger for safety. As it settles there, his step-mother, aware all the while, suddenly presses his hand over it. He found the ring there that night as he lay; left his bed in the darkness, and again, for safety, put it on the finger of the image, wedding once for all that so kindly mystical mother. And still, even amid his earthly mother's terrible misgivings, he seems to foresee a charming career marked out before him in friendly Athens, to the height of his desire. Grateful that he is here at all, sharing at last so freely life's banquet, he puts himself for a moment in his old place, recalling his old enjoyment of the pleasure of others; [180] feels, just then, no different. Yet never had life seemed so sufficing as at this moment- -the meat, the drink, the drives, the popularity as he comes and goes, even his step-mother's false, selfish, ostentatious gifts. But she, too, begins to feel something of the jealousy of that other divine, would-be mistress, and by way of a last effort to bring him to a better mind in regard to them both, conducts him (immeasurable privilege!) to her own private chapel. You could hardly tell where the apartments of the adulteress ended and that of the divine courtesan began. Haunts of her long, indolent, self-pleasing nights and days, they presented everywhere the impress of Phaedra's luxurious humour. A peculiar glow, such as he had never before seen, like heady lamplight, or sunshine to some sleeper in a delirious dream, hung upon, clung to, the bold, naked, shameful imageries, as his step-mother trimmed the lamps, drew forth her sickly perfumes, clad afresh in piquant change of raiment the almost formless goddess crouching there in her unclean shrine or stye, set at last her foolish wheel in motion to a low chant, holding him by the wrist, keeping close all the while, as if to catch some germ of consent in his indifferent words. And little by little he perceives that all this is for him--the incense, the dizzy wheel, the shreds of stuff cut secretly from his sleeve, the sweetened cup he drank at her offer, unavailingly;+ [181] and yes! his own features surely, in pallid wax. With a gasp of flighty laughter she ventures to point the thing out to him, full as he is at last of visible, irrepressible dislike. Ah! it was that very reluctance that chiefly stirred her. Healthily white and red, he had a marvellous air of discretion about him, as of one never to be caught unaware, as if he never could be anything but like water from the rock, or the wild flowers of the morning, or the beams of the morning star turned to human flesh. It was the self-possession of this happy mind, the purity of this virgin body, she would fain have perturbed, as a pledge to herself of her own gaudy claim to supremacy. King Theseus, as she knew, had had at least two earlier loves; for once she would be a first love; felt at moments that with this one passion once indulged, it might be happiness thereafter to remain chaste for ever. And then, by accident, yet surely reading indifference in his manner of accepting her gifts, she is ready again for contemptuous, open battle. Is he indeed but a child still, this nursling of the forbidding Amazon, of that Amazonian goddess--to be a child always? or a wily priest rather, skilfully circumventing her sorceries, with mystic precautions of his own? In truth, there is something of the priestly character in this impassible discretion, reminding her of his alleged intimacy with the rival goddess, and redoubling her curiosity, her fondness.+ [182] Phaedra, love-sick, feverish, in bodily sickness at last, raves of the cool woods, the chase, the steeds of Hippolytus, her thoughts running madly on what she fancies to be his secret business; with a storm of abject tears, foreseeing in one moment of recoil the weary tale of years to come, star-stricken as she declares, she dared at last to confess her longing to already half-suspicious attendants; and, awake one morning to find Hippolytus there kindly at her bidding, drove him openly forth in a tempest of insulting speech. There was a mordant there, like the menace of misfortune to come, in which the injured goddess also was invited to concur. What words! what terrible words! following, clinging to him, like acrid fire upon his bare flesh, as he hasted from Phaedra's house, thrust out at last, his vesture remaining in her hands. The husband returning suddenly, she tells him a false story of violence to her bed, and is believed. King Theseus, all his accumulated store of suspicion and dislike turning now to active hatred, flung away readily upon him, bewildered, unheard, one of three precious curses (some mystery of wasting sickness therein) with which Poseidon had indulged him. It seemed sad that one so young must call for justice, precariously, upon the gods, the dead, the very walls! Admiring youth dared hardly bid farewell to their late comrade; are generous, at most, in [183] stolen, sympathetic glances towards the fallen star. At home, veiled once again in that ancient twilight world, his mother, fearing solely for what he may suffer by the departure of that so brief prosperity, enlarged as it had been, even so, by his grateful taking of it, is reassured, delighted, happy once more at the visible proof of his happiness, his invincible happiness. Duly he returned to Athens, early astir, for the last time, to restore the forfeited gifts, drove back his gaily painted chariot to leave there behind him, actually enjoying the drive, going home on foot poorer than ever. He takes again to his former modes of life, a little less to the horses, a little more to the old studies, the strange, secret history of his favourite goddess,--wronged surely! somehow, she too, as powerless to help him; till he lay sick at last, battling one morning, unaware of his mother's presence, with the feverish creations of the brain; the giddy, foolish wheel, the foolish song, of Phaedra's chapel, spinning there with his heart bound thereto. \"The curses of my progenitors are come upon me!\" he cries. \"And yet, why so? guiltless as I am of evil.\" His wholesome religion seeming to turn against him now, the trees, the streams, the very rocks, swoon into living creatures, swarming around the goddess who has lost her grave quietness. He finds solicitation, and recoils, in the wind, in the sounds of the rain; till at length delirium [184] itself finds a note of returning health. The feverish wood-ways of his fancy open unexpectedly upon wide currents of air, lulling him to sleep; and the conflict ending suddenly altogether at its sharpest, he lay in the early light motionless among the pillows, his mother standing by, as she thought, to see him die. As if for the last time, she presses on him the things he had liked best in that eating and drinking she had found so beautiful. The eyes, the eyelids are big with sorrow; and, as he understands again, making an effort for her sake, the healthy light returns into his; a hand seizes hers gratefully, and a slow convalescence begins, the happiest period in the wild mother's life. When he longed for flowers for the goddess, she went a toilsome journey to seek them, growing close, after long neglect, wholesome and firm on their tall stalks. The singing she had longed for so despairingly hovers gaily once more within the chapel and around the house. At the crisis of that strange illness she had supposed her long forebodings about to be realised at last; but upon his recovery feared no more, assured herself that the curses of the father, the step-mother, the concurrent ill-will of that angry goddess, have done their utmost; he will outlive her; a few years hence put her to a rest surely welcome. Her misgivings, arising always out of the actual spectacle of his profound happiness, seemed at an end in this meek bliss, the more as [185] she observed that it was a shade less unconscious than of old. And almost suddenly he found the strength, the heart, in him, to try his fortune again with the old chariot; and those still unsatisfied curses, in truth, going on either side of him like living creatures unseen, legend tells briefly how, a competitor for pity with Adonis, and Icarus, and Hyacinth, and other doomed creatures of immature radiance in all story to come, he set forth joyously for the chariot-races, not of Athens, but of Troezen, her rival. Once more he wins the prize; he says good-bye to admiring friends anxious to entertain him, and by night starts off homewards, as of old, like a child, returning quickly through the solitude in which he had never lacked company, and was now to die. Through all the perils of darkness he had guided the chariot safely along the curved shore; the dawn was come, and a little breeze astir, as the grey level spaces parted delicately into white and blue, when in a moment an earthquake, or Poseidon the earth-shaker himself, or angry Aphrodite awake from the deep betimes, rent the tranquil surface; a great wave leapt suddenly into the placid distance of the Attic shore, and was surging here to the very necks of the plunging horses, a moment since enjoying so pleasantly with him the caress of the morning air, but now, wholly forgetful of their old affectionate habit of obedience, dragging their leader headlong over the rough pavements. [186] Evening and the dawn might seem to have met on that hapless day through which they drew him home entangled in the trappings of the chariot that had been his ruin, till he lay at length, grey and haggard, at the rest he had longed for dimly amid the buffeting of those murderous stones, his mother watching impassibly, sunk at once into the condition she had so long anticipated. Later legend breaks a supernatural light over that great desolation, and would fain relieve the reader by introducing the kindly Asclepius, who presently restores the youth to life, not, however, in the old form or under familiar conditions. To her, surely, counting the wounds, the disfigurements, telling over the pains which had shot through that dear head now insensible to her touch among the pillows under the harsh broad daylight, that would have been no more of a solace than if, according to the fancy of Ovid, he flourished still, a little deity, but under a new name and veiled now in old age, in the haunted grove of Aricia, far from his old Attic home, in a land which had never seen him as he was. THE BEGINNINGS OF GREEK SCULPTURE I: THE HEROIC AGE OF GREEK ART [187] THE extant remains of Greek sculpture, though but a fragment of what the Greek sculptors produced, are, both in number and in excellence, in their fitness, therefore, to represent the whole of which they were a part, quite out of proportion to what has come down to us of Greek painting, and all those minor crafts which, in the Greek workshop, as at all periods when the arts have been really vigorous, were closely connected with the highest imaginative work. Greek painting is represented to us only by its distant reflexion on the walls of the buried houses of Pompeii, and the designs of subordinate though exquisite craftsmen on the vases. Of wrought metal, partly through the inherent usefulness of its material, tempting ignorant persons into whose hands it may fall to re-fashion it, we have comparatively little; while, in consequence of the perishableness of their material, nothing [188] remains of the curious wood-work, the carved ivory, the embroidery and coloured stuffs, on which the Greeks set much store--of that whole system of refined artisanship, diffused, like a general atmosphere of beauty and richness, around the more exalted creations of Greek sculpture. What we possess, then, of that highest Greek sculpture is presented to us in a sort of threefold isolation; isolation, first of all, from the concomitant arts--the frieze of the Parthenon without the metal bridles on the horses, for which the holes in the marble remain; isolation, secondly, from the architectural group of which, with most careful estimate of distance and point of observation, that frieze, for instance, was designed to be a part; isolation, thirdly, from the clear Greek skies, the poetical Greek life, in our modern galleries. And if one here or there, in looking at these things, bethinks himself of the required substitution; if he endeavours mentally to throw them back into that proper atmosphere, through which alone they can exercise over us all the magic by which they charmed their original spectators, the effort is not always a successful one, within the grey walls of the Louvre or the British Museum. And the circumstance that Greek sculpture is presented to us in such falsifying isolation from the work of the weaver, the carpenter, and the goldsmith, has encouraged a manner of regarding it too little sensuous. Approaching it with full [189] information concerning what may be called the inner life of the Greeks, their modes of thought and sentiment amply recorded in the writings of the Greek poets and philosophers, but with no lively impressions of that mere craftsman's world of which so little has remained, students of antiquity have for the most part interpreted the creations of Greek sculpture, rather as elements in a sequence of abstract ideas, as embodiments, in a sort of petrified language, of pure thoughts, and as interesting mainly in connexion with the development of Greek intellect, than as elements of a sequence in the material order, as results of a designed and skilful dealing of accomplished fingers with precious forms of matter for the delight of the eyes. Greek sculpture has come to be regarded as the product of a peculiarly limited art, dealing with a specially abstracted range of subjects; and the Greek sculptor as a workman almost exclusively intellectual, having only a sort of accidental connexion with the material in which his thought was expressed. He is fancied to have been disdainful of such matters as the mere tone, the fibre or texture, of his marble or cedar-wood, of that just perceptible yellowness, for instance, in the ivory-like surface of the Venus of Melos; as being occupied only with forms as abstract almost as the conceptions of philosophy, and translateable it might be supposed into any material--a habit of regarding him still further encouraged by the modern [190] sculptor's usage of employing merely mechanical labour in the actual working of the stone. The works of the highest Greek sculpture are indeed intellectualised, if we may say so, to the utmost degree; the human figures which they present to us seem actually to conceive thoughts; in them, that profoundly reasonable spirit of design which is traceable in Greek art, continuously and increasingly, upwards from its simplest products, the oil-vessel or the urn, reaches its perfection. Yet, though the most abstract and intellectualised of sensuous objects, they are still sensuous and material, addressing themselves, in the first instance, not to the purely reflective faculty, but to the eye; and a complete criticism must have approached them from both sides-- from the side of the intelligence indeed, towards which they rank as great thoughts come down into the stone; but from the sensuous side also, towards which they rank as the most perfect results of that pure skill of hand, of which the Venus of Melos, we may say, is the highest example, and the little polished pitcher or lamp, also perfect in its way, perhaps the lowest. To pass by the purely visible side of these things, then, is not only to miss a refining pleasure, but to mistake altogether the medium in which the most intellectual of the creations of Greek art, the Aeginetan or the Elgin marbles, for instance, were actually produced; even these having, in their origin, depended for much of [191] their charm on the mere material in which they were executed; and the whole black and grey world of extant antique sculpture needing to be translated back into ivory and gold, if we would feel the excitement which the Greek seems to have felt in the presence of these objects. To have this really Greek sense of Greek sculpture, it is necessary to connect it, indeed, with the inner life of the Greek world, its thought and sentiment, on the one hand; but on the other hand to connect it, also, with the minor works of price, intaglios, coins, vases; with that whole system of material refinement and beauty in the outer Greek life, which these minor works represent to us; and it is with these, as far as possible, that we must seek to relieve the air of our galleries and museums of their too intellectual greyness. Greek sculpture could not have been precisely a cold thing; and, whatever a colour-blind school may say, pure thoughts have their coldness, a coldness which has sometimes repelled from Greek sculpture, with its unsuspected fund of passion and energy in material form, those who cared much, and with much insight, for a similar passion and energy in the coloured world of Italian painting. Theoretically, then, we need that world of the minor arts as a complementary background for the higher and more austere Greek sculpture; and, as matter of fact, it is just with such a world--with a period of refined and exquisite [192] tectonics+ (as the Greeks called all crafts strictly subordinate to architecture), that Greek art actually begins, in what is called the Heroic Age, that earliest, undefined period of Greek civilisation, the beginning of which cannot be dated, and which reaches down to the first Olympiad, about the year 776 B.C. Of this period we possess, indeed, no direct history, and but few actual monuments, great or small; but as to its whole character and outward local colouring, for its art, as for its politics and religion, Homer may be regarded as an authority. The Iliad and the Odyssey, the earliest pictures of that heroic life, represent it as already delighting itself in the application of precious material and skilful handiwork to personal and domestic adornment, to the refining and beautifying of the entire outward aspect of life; above all, in the lavish application of very graceful metal-work to such purposes. And this representation is borne out by what little we possess of its actual remains, and by all we can infer. Mixed, of course, with mere fable, as a description of the heroic age, the picture which Homer presents to us, deprived of its supernatural adjuncts, becomes continuously more and more realisable as the actual condition of early art, when we emerge gradually into historical time, and find ourselves at last among dateable works and real schools or masters. The history of Greek art, then, begins, as some have fancied general history to begin, in a [193] golden age, but in an age, so to speak, of real gold, the period of those first twisters and hammerers of the precious metals--men who had already discovered the flexibility of silver and the ductility of gold, the capacity of both for infinite delicacy of handling, and who enjoyed, with complete freshness, a sense of beauty and fitness in their work--a period of which that flower of gold on a silver stalk, picked up lately in one of the graves at Mycenae, or the legendary golden honeycomb of Daedalus, might serve as the symbol. The heroic age of Greek art is the age of the hero as smith. There are in Homer two famous descriptive passages in which this delight in curious metal-work is very prominent; the description in the Iliad of the shield of Achilles* and the description of the house of Alcinous in the Odyssey.* The shield of Achilles is part of the suit of armour which Hephaestus makes for him at the request of Thetis; and it is wrought of variously Coloured metals, woven into a great circular composition in relief, representing the world and the life in it. The various activities of man are recorded in this description in a series of idyllic incidents with such complete freshness, liveliness, and variety, that the reader from time to time may well forget himself, and fancy he is reading a mere description of the incidents of actual life. [194] We peep into a little Greek town, and see in dainty miniature the bride coming from her chamber with torch-bearers and dancers, the people gazing from their doors, a quarrel between two persons in the market-place, the assembly of the elders to decide upon it. In another quartering is the spectacle of a city besieged, the walls defended by the old men, while the soldiers have stolen out and are lying in ambush. There is a fight on the river-bank; Ares and Athene, conspicuous in gold, and marked as divine persons by a scale larger than that of their followers, lead the host. The strange, mythical images of Kêr, Eris, and Kudoimos mingle in the crowd. A third space upon the shield depicts the incidents of peaceful labour--the ploughshare passing through the field, of enameled black metal behind it, and golden before; the cup of mead held out to the ploughman when he reaches the end of the furrow; the reapers with their sheaves; the king standing in silent pleasure among them, intent upon his staff. There are the labourers in the vineyard in minutest detail; stakes of silver on which the vines hang; the dark trench about it, and one pathway through the midst; the whole complete and distinct, in variously coloured metal. All things and living creatures are in their places--the cattle coming to water to the sound of the herdsman's pipe, various music, the rushes by the water-side, a lion-hunt with dogs, [195] the pastures among the hills, a dance, the fair dresses of the male and female dancers, the former adorned with swords, the latter with crowns. It is an image of ancient life, its pleasure and business. For the centre, as in some quaint chart of the heavens, are the earth and the sun, the moon and constellations; and to close in all, right round, like a frame to the picture, the great river Oceanus, forming the rim of the shield, in some metal of dark blue. Still more fascinating, perhaps, because more completely realisable by the fancy as an actual thing--realisable as a delightful place to pass time in--is the description of the palace of Alcinous in the little island town of the Phaeacians, to which we are introduced in all the liveliness and sparkle of the morning, as real as something seen last summer on the sea-coast; although, appropriately, Ulysses meets a goddess, like a young girl carrying a pitcher, on his way up from the sea. Below the steep walls of the town, two projecting jetties allow a narrow passage into a haven of stone for the ships, into which the passer-by may look down, as they lie moored below the roadway. In the midst is the king's house, all glittering, again, with curiously wrought metal; its brightness is \"as the brightness of the sun or of the moon.\" The heart of Ulysses beats quickly when he sees it standing amid plantations ingeniously watered, its floor and walls of brass throughout, with continuous [196] cornice of dark iron; the doors are of gold, the door-posts and lintels of silver, the handles, again, of gold-- The walls were massy brass; the cornice high Blue metals crowned in colours of the sky; Rich plates of gold the folding-doors incase; The pillars silver on a brazen base; Silver the lintels deep-projecting o'er; And gold the ringlets that command the door. Dogs of the same precious metals keep watch on either side, like the lions over the old gate-way of Mycenae, or the gigantic, human-headed bulls at the entrance of an Assyrian palace. Within doors the burning lights at supper-time are supported in the hands of golden images of boys, while the guests recline on a couch running all along the wall, covered with peculiarly sumptuous women's work. From these two glittering descriptions manifestly something must be deducted; we are in wonder-land, and among supernatural or magical conditions. But the forging of the shield and the wonderful house of Alcinous are no merely incongruous episodes in Homer, but the consummation of what is always characteristic of him, a constant preoccupation, namely, with every form of lovely craftsmanship, resting on all things, as he says, like the shining of the sun. We seem to pass, in reading him, through the treasures of some royal collection; in him the presentation of almost every aspect of life is [197] beautified by the work of cunning hands. The thrones, coffers, couches of curious carpentry, are studded with bossy ornaments of precious metal effectively disposed, or inlaid with stained ivory, or blue cyanus, or amber, or pale amber-like gold; the surfaces of the stone conduits, the sea-walls, the public washing-troughs, the ramparts on which the weary soldiers rest themselves when returned to Troy, are fair and smooth; all the fine qualities, in colour and texture, of woven stuff are carefully noted--the fineness, closeness, softness, pliancy, gloss, the whiteness or nectar-like tints in which the weaver delights to work; to weave the sea-purple threads is the appropriate function of queens and noble women. All the Homeric shields are more or less ornamented with variously coloured metal, terrible sometimes, like Leonardo's, with some monster or grotesque. The numerous sorts of cups are bossed with golden studs, or have handles wrought with figures, of doves, for instance. The great brazen cauldrons bear an epithet which means flowery. The trappings of the horses, the various parts of the chariots, are formed of various metals. The women's ornaments and the instruments of their toilet are described-- porpas te gnamptas th' helikas, kalukas te kai hormous+ --the golden vials for unguents. Use and beauty are still undivided; all that men's hands are set to make has still a fascination alike for workmen [198] and spectators. For such dainty splendour Troy, indeed, is especially conspicuous. But then Homer's Trojans are essentially Greeks--Greeks of Asia; and Troy, though more advanced in all elements of civilisation, is no real contrast to the western shore of the Aegean. It is no barbaric world that we see, but the sort of world, we may think, that would have charmed also our comparatively jaded sensibilities, with just that quaint simplicity which we too enjoy in its productions; above all, in its wrought metal, which loses perhaps more than any other sort of work by becoming mechanical. The metal-work which Homer describes in such variety is all hammer-work, all the joinings being effected by pins or riveting. That is just the sort of metal-work which, in a certain naïveté and vigour, is still of all work the most expressive of actual contact with dexterous fingers; one seems to trace in it, on every particle of the partially resisting material, the touch and play of the shaping instruments, in highly trained hands, under the guidance of exquisitely disciplined senses--that cachet, or seal of nearness to the workman's hand, which is the special charm of all good metal-work, of early metal-work in particular. Such descriptions, however, it may be said, are mere poetical ornament, of no value in helping us to define the character of an age. But what is peculiar in these Homeric descriptions, [199] what distinguishes them from others at first sight similar, is a sort of internal evidence they present of a certain degree of reality, signs in them of an imagination stirred by surprise at the spectacle of real works of art. Such minute, delighted, loving description of details of ornament, such following out of the ways in which brass, gold, silver, or paler gold, go into the chariots and armour and women's dress, or cling to the walls--the enthusiasm of the manner-- is the warrant of a certain amount of truth in all that. The Greek poet describes these things with the same vividness and freshness, the same kind of fondness, with which other poets speak of flowers; speaking of them poetically, indeed, but with that higher sort of poetry which seems full of the lively impression of delightful things recently seen. Genuine poetry, it is true, is always naturally sympathetic with all beautiful sensible things and qualities. But with how many poets would not this constant intrusion of material ornament have produced a tawdry effect! The metal would all be tarnished and the edges blurred. And this is because it is not always that the products of even exquisite tectonics can excite or refine the aesthetic sense. Now it is probable that the objects of oriental art, the imitations of it at home, in which for Homer this actual world of art must have consisted, reached him in a quantity, and with a novelty, just sufficient to warm and stimulate without [200] surfeiting the imagination; it is an exotic thing of which he sees just enough and not too much. The shield of Achilles, the house of Alcinous, are like dreams indeed, but this sort of dreaming winds continuously through the entire Iliad and Odyssey--a child's dream after a day of real, fresh impressions from things themselves, in which all those floating impressions re-set themselves. He is as pleased in touching and looking at those objects as his own heroes; their gleaming aspect brightens all he says, and has taken hold, one might think, of his language, his very vocabulary becoming chryselephantine. Homer's artistic descriptions, though enlarged by fancy, are not wholly imaginary, and the extant remains of monuments of the earliest historical age are like lingering relics of that dream in a tamer but real world. The art of the heroic age, then, as represented in Homer, connects itself, on the one side, with those fabulous jewels so prominent in mythological story, and entwined sometimes so oddly in its representation of human fortunes--the necklace of Eriphyle, the necklace of Helen, which Menelaus, it was said, offered at Delphi to Athene Pronoea, on the eve of his expedition against Troy--mythical objects, indeed, but which yet bear witness even thus early to the aesthetic susceptibility of the Greek temper. But, on the other hand, the art of the heroic age connects itself also with the actual early beginnings [201] of artistic production. There are touches of reality, for instance, in Homer's incidental notices of its instruments and processes; especially as regards the working of metal. He goes already to the potter's wheel for familiar, life-like illustration. In describing artistic wood-work he distinguishes various stages of work; we see clearly the instruments for turning and boring, such as the old-fashioned drill-borer, whirled round with a string; he mentions the names of two artists, the one of an actual workman, the other of a craft turned into a proper name--stray relics, accidentally preserved, of a world, as we may believe, of such wide and varied activity. The forge of Hephaestus is a true forge; the magic tripods on which he is at work are really put together by conceivable processes, known in early times. Compositions in relief similar to those which he describes were actually made out of thin metal plates cut into a convenient shape, and then beaten into the designed form by the hammer over a wooden model. These reliefs were then fastened to a differently coloured metal background or base, with nails or rivets, for there is no soldering of metals as yet. To this process the ancients gave the name of empaestik,+ such embossing being still, in our own time, a beautiful form of metal-work. Even in the marvellous shield there are other and indirect notes of reality. In speaking of the shield of Achilles, I departed intentionally from [202] the order in which the subjects of the relief are actually introduced in the Iliad, because, just then, I wished the reader to receive the full effect of the variety and elaborateness of the composition, as a representation or picture of the whole of ancient life embraced within the circumference of a shield. But in the order in which Homer actually describes those episodes he is following the method of a very practicable form of composition, and is throughout much closer than we might at first sight suppose to the ancient armourer's proceedings. The shield is formed of five superimposed plates of different metals, each plate of smaller diameter than the one immediately below it, their flat margins showing thus as four concentric stripes or rings of metal, around a sort of boss in the centre, five metals thick, and the outermost circle or ring being the thinnest. To this arrangement the order of Homer's description corresponds. The earth and the heavenly bodies are upon this boss in the centre, like a little distant heaven hung above the broad world, and from this Homer works out, round and round, to the river Oceanus, which forms the border of the whole; the subjects answering to, or supporting each other, in a sort of heraldic order--the city at peace set over against the city besieged- -spring, summer, and autumn balancing each other--quite congruously with a certain heraldic turn common in contemporary Assyrian art, which delights in [203] this sort of conventional spacing out of its various subjects, and especially with some extant metal chargers of Assyrian work, which, like some of the earliest Greek vases with their painted plants and flowers conventionally arranged, illustrate in their humble measure such heraldic grouping. The description of the shield of Hercules, attributed to Hesiod, is probably an imitation of Homer, and, notwithstanding some fine mythological impersonations which it contains, an imitation less admirable than the original. Of painting there are in Homer no certain indications, and it is consistent with the later date of the imitator that we may perhaps discern in his composition a sign that what he had actually seen was a painted shield, in the pre-dominance in it, as compared with the Homeric description, of effects of colour over effects of form; Homer delighting in ingenious devices for fastening the metal, and the supposed Hesiod rather in what seem like triumphs of heraldic colouring; though the latter also delights in effects of mingled metals, of mingled gold and silver especially-- silver figures with dresses of gold, silver centaurs with pine-trees of gold for staves in their hands. Still, like the shield of Achilles, this too we must conceive as formed of concentric plates of metal; and here again that spacing is still more elaborately carried out, narrower intermediate rings being apparently [204] introduced between the broader ones, with figures in rapid, horizontal, unbroken motion, carrying the eye right round the shield, in contrast with the repose of the downward or inward movement of the subjects which divide the larger spaces; here too with certain analogies in the rows of animals to the designs on the earliest vases. In Hesiod then, as in Homer, there are undesigned notes of correspondence between the partly mythical ornaments imaginatively enlarged of the heroic age, and a world of actual handicrafts. In the shield of Hercules another marvellous detail is added in the image of Perseus, very daintily described as hovering in some wonderful way, as if really borne up by wings, above the surface. And that curious, haunting sense of magic in art, which comes out over and over again in Homer--in the golden maids, for instance, who assist Hephaestus in his work, and similar details which seem at first sight to destroy the credibility of the whole picture, and make of it a mere wonder-land--is itself also, rightly understood, a testimony to a real excellence in the art of Homer's time. It is sometimes said that works of art held to be miraculous are always of an inferior kind; but at least it was not among those who thought them inferior that the belief in their miraculous power began. If the golden images move like living creatures, and the armour of Achilles, so [205] wonderfully made, lifts him like wings, this again is because the imagination of Homer is really under the stimulus of delightful artistic objects actually seen. Only those to whom such artistic objects manifest themselves through real and powerful impressions of their wonderful qualities, can invest them with properties magical or miraculous. I said that the inherent usefulness of the material of metal-work makes the destruction of its acquired form almost certain, if it comes into the possession of people either barbarous or careless of the work of a past time. Greek art is for us, in all its stages, a fragment only; in each of them it is necessary, in a somewhat visionary manner, to fill up empty spaces, and more or less make substitution; and of the finer work of the heroic age, thus dimly discerned as an actual thing, we had at least till recently almost nothing. Two plates of bronze, a few rusty nails, and certain rows of holes in the inner surface of the walls of the \"treasury\" of Mycenae, were the sole representatives of that favourite device of primitive Greek art, the lining of stone walls with burnished metal, of which the house of Alcinous in the Odyssey is the ideal picture, and the temple of Pallas of the Brazen House at Sparta, adorned in the interior with a coating of reliefs in metal, a later, historical example. Of the heroic or so-called Cyclopean architecture, that \"treasury,\" [206] a building so imposing that Pausanias thought it worthy to rank with the Pyramids, is a sufficient illustration. Treasury, or tomb, or both (the selfish dead, perhaps, being supposed still to find enjoyment in the costly armour, goblets, and mirrors laid up there), this dome-shaped building, formed of concentric rings of stones gradually diminishing to a coping-stone at the top, may stand as the representative of some similar buildings in other parts of Greece, and of many others in a similar kind of architecture elsewhere, constructed of large many-sided blocks of stone, fitted carefully together without the aid of cement, and remaining in their places by reciprocal resistance. Characteristic of it is the general tendency to use vast blocks of stone for the jambs and lintels of doors, for instance, and in the construction of gable-shaped passages; two rows of such stones being made to rest against each other at an acute angle, within the thickness of the walls. So vast and rude, fretted by the action of nearly three thousand years, the fragments of this architecture may often seem, at first sight, like works of nature. At Argos, Tiryns, Mycenae, the skeleton of the old architecture is more complete. At Mycenae the gateway of the acropolis is still standing with its two well-known sculptured lions--immemorial and almost unique monument of primitive Greek sculpture--supporting, herald-wise, a symbolical pillar on the [207] vast, triangular, pedimental stone above. The heads are gone, having been fashioned possibly in metal by workmen from the East. On what may be called the façade, remains are still discernible of inlaid work in coloured stone, and within the gateway, on the smooth slabs of the pavement, the wheel-ruts are still visible. Connect them with those metal war-chariots in Homer, and you may see in fancy the whole grandiose character of the place, as it may really have been. Shut within the narrow enclosure of these shadowy citadels were the palaces of the kings, with all that intimacy which we may sometimes suppose to have been alien from the open-air Greek life, admitting, doubtless, below the cover of their rough walls, many of those refinements of princely life which the Middle Age found possible in such places, and of which the impression is so fascinating in Homer's description, for instance, of the house of Ulysses, or of Menelaus at Sparta. Rough and frowning without, these old châteaux of the Argive kings were delicate within with a decoration almost as dainty and fine as the network of weed and flower that now covers their ruins, and of the delicacy of which, as I said, that golden flower on its silver stalk or the golden honeycomb of Daedalus, might be taken as representative. In these metal-like structures of self-supporting polygons, locked so firmly and impenetrably together, with the whole mystery of the reasonableness [208] of the arch implicitly within them, there is evidence of a complete artistic command over weight in stone, and an understanding of the \"law of weight.\" But over weight only; the ornament still seems to be not strictly architectural, but, according to the notices of Homer, tectonic, borrowed from the sister arts, above all from the art of the metal-workers, to whom those spaces of the building are left which a later age fills with painting, or relief in stone. The skill of the Asiatic comes to adorn this rough native building; and it is a late, elaborate, somewhat voluptuous skill, we may understand, illustrated by the luxury of that Asiatic chamber of Paris, less like that of a warrior than of one going to the dance. Coupled with the vastness of the architectural works which actually remain, such descriptions as that in Homer of the chamber of Paris and the house of Alcinous furnish forth a picture of that early period--the tyrants' age, the age of the acropoleis, the period of great dynasties with claims to \"divine right\"' and in many instances at least with all the culture of their time. The vast buildings make us sigh at the thought of wasted human labour, though there is a public usefulness too in some of these designs, such as the draining of the Copaic lake, to which the backs of the people are bent whether they will or not. For the princes there is much of that selfish personal luxury which is a constant trait of feudalism in [209] all ages. For the people, scattered over the country, at their agricultural labour, or gathered in small hamlets, there is some enjoyment, perhaps, of the aspect of that splendour, of the bright warriors on the heights--a certain share of the nobler pride of the tyrants themselves in those tombs and dwellings. Some surmise, also, there seems to have been, of the \"curse\" of gold, with a dim, lurking suspicion of curious facilities for cruelty in the command over those skilful artificers in metal-- some ingenious rack or bull \"to pinch and peel\"--the tradition of which, not unlike the modern Jacques Bonhomme's shudder at the old ruined French donjon or bastille, haunts, generations afterwards, the ruins of those \"labyrinths\" of stone, where the old tyrants had their pleasures. For it is a mistake to suppose that that wistful sense of eeriness in ruined buildings, to which most of us are susceptible, is an exclusively modern feeling. The name Cyclopean, attached to those desolate remains of buildings which were older than Greek history itself, attests their romantic influence over the fancy of the people who thus attributed them to a superhuman strength and skill. And the Cyclopes, like all the early mythical names of artists, have this note of reality, that they are names not of individuals but of classes, the guilds or companies of workmen in which a certain craft was imparted and transmitted. The Dactyli, the Fingers, are the [210] first workers in iron; the savage Chalybes in Scythia the first smelters; actual names are given to the old, fabled Telchines-- Chalkon, Argyron, Chryson--workers in brass, silver, and gold, respectively.+ The tradition of their activity haunts the several regions where those metals were found. They make the trident of Poseidon; but then Poseidon's trident is a real fisherman's instrument, the tunny-fork. They are credited, notwithstanding, with an evil sorcery, unfriendly to men, as poor humanity remembered the makers of chains, locks, Procrustean beds; and, as becomes this dark recondite mine and metal work, the traditions about them are gloomy and grotesque, confusing mortal workmen with demon guilds. To this view of the heroic age of Greek art as being, so to speak, an age of real gold, an age delighting itself in precious material and exquisite handiwork in all tectonic crafts, the recent extraordinary discoveries at Troy and Mycenae are, on any plausible theory of their date and origin, a witness. The aesthetic critic needs always to be on his guard against the confusion of mere curiosity or antiquity with beauty in art. Among the objects discovered at Troy--mere curiosities, some of them, however interesting and instructive--the so-called royal cup of Priam, in solid gold, two-handled and double- lipped, (the smaller lip designed for the host and his libation, the larger for the guest,) has, in the [211] very simplicity of its design, the grace of the economy with which it exactly fulfils its purpose, a positive beauty, an absolute value for the aesthetic sense, while strange and new enough, if it really settles at last a much-debated expression of Homer; while the \"diadem,\" with its twisted chains and flowers of pale gold, shows that those profuse golden fringes, waving so comely as he moved, which Hephaestus wrought for the helmet of Achilles, were really within the compass of early Greek art. And the story of the excavations at Mycenae reads more like some well-devised chapter of fiction than a record of sober facts. Here, those sanguine, half-childish dreams of buried treasure discovered in dead men's graves, which seem to have a charm for every one, are more than fulfilled in the spectacle of those antique kings, lying in the splendour of their crowns and breastplates of embossed plate of gold; their swords, studded with golden imagery, at their sides, as in some feudal monument; their very faces covered up most strangely in golden masks. The very floor of one tomb, we read, was thick with gold- dust--the heavy gilding fallen from some perished kingly vestment; in another was a downfall of golden leaves and flowers; and, amid this profusion of thin fine fragments, were rings, bracelets, smaller crowns as if for children, dainty butterflies for ornaments of dresses, and that golden flower on a silver stalk--all of pure, [212] soft gold, unhardened by alloy, the delicate films of which one must touch but lightly, yet twisted and beaten, by hand and hammer, into wavy, spiral relief, the cuttle-fish with its long undulating arms appearing frequently. It is the very image of the old luxurious life of the princes of the heroic age, as Homer describes it, with the arts in service to its kingly pride. Among the other costly objects was one representing the head of a cow, grandly designed in gold with horns of silver, like the horns of the moon, supposed to be symbolical of Here, the great object of worship at Argos. One of the interests of the study of mythology is that it reflects the ways of life and thought of the people who conceived it; and this religion of Here, the special religion of Argos, is congruous with what has been here said as to the place of art in the civilisation of the Argives; it is a reflexion of that splendid and wanton old feudal life. For Here is, in her original essence and meaning, equivalent to Demeter--the one living spirit of the earth, divined behind the veil of all its manifold visible energies. But in the development of a common mythological motive the various peoples are subject to the general limitations of their life and thought; they can but work outward what is within them; and the religious conceptions and usages, ultimately derivable from one and the same rudimentary instinct, are sometimes most diverse. Out of [213] the visible, physical energies of the earth and its system of annual change, the old Pelasgian mind developed the person of Demeter, mystical and profoundly aweful, yet profoundly pathetic, also, in her appeal to human sympathies. Out of the same original elements, the civilisation of Argos, on the other hand, developes the religion of Queen Here, a mere Demeter, at best, of gaudy flower-beds, whose toilet Homer describes with all its delicate fineries; though, characteristically, he may still allow us to detect, perhaps, some traces of the mystical person of the earth, in the all-pervading scent of the ambrosial unguent with which she anoints herself, in the abundant tresses of her hair, and in the curious variegation of her ornaments. She has become, though with some reminiscence of the mystical earth, a very limited human person, wicked, angry, jealous--the lady of Zeus in her castle-sanctuary at Mycenae, in wanton dalliance with the king, coaxing him for cruel purposes in sweet sleep, adding artificial charms to her beauty. Such are some of the characteristics with which Greek art is discernible in that earliest age. Of themselves, they almost answer the question which next arises--Whence did art come to Greece? or was it a thing of absolutely native growth there? So some have decidedly maintained. Others, who lived in an age possessing little or no knowledge of Greek monuments anterior to the full development of art under [214] Pheidias, and who, in regard to the Greek sculpture of the age of Pheidias, were like people criticising Michelangelo, without knowledge of the earlier Tuscan school--of the works of Donatello and Mino da Fiesole--easily satisfied themselves with theories of its importation ready-made from other countries. Critics in the last century, especially, noticing some characteristics which early Greek work has in common, indeed, with Egyptian art, but which are common also to all such early work everywhere, supposed, as a matter of course, that it came, as the Greek religion also, from Egypt--that old, immemorial half-known birthplace of all wonderful things. There are, it is true, authorities for this derivation among the Greeks themselves, dazzled as they were by the marvels of the ancient civilisation of Egypt, a civilisation so different from their own, on the first opening of Egypt to Greek visitors. But, in fact, that opening did not take place till the reign of Psammetichus, about the middle of the seventh century B.C., a relatively late date. Psammetichus introduced and settled Greek mercenaries in Egypt, and, for a time, the Greeks came very close to Egyptian life. They can hardly fail to have been stimulated by that display of every kind of artistic workmanship gleaming over the whole of life; they may in turn have freshened it with new motives. And we may remark, that but for the peculiar usage of Egypt concerning the tombs of the dead, but [215] for their habit of investing the last abodes of the dead with all the appurtenances of active life, out of that whole world of art, so various and elaborate, nothing but the great, monumental works in stone would have remained to ourselves. We should have experienced in regard to it, what we actually experience too much in our knowledge of Greek art--the lack of a fitting background, in the smaller tectonic work, for its great works in architecture, and the bolder sort of sculpture. But, one by one, at last, as in the medieval parallel, monuments illustrative of the earlier growth of Greek art before the time of Pheidias have come to light, and to a just appreciation. They show that the development of Greek art had already proceeded some way before the opening of Egypt to the Greeks, and point, if to a foreign source at all, to oriental rather than Egyptian influences; and the theory which derived Greek art, with many other Greek things, from Egypt, now hardly finds supporters. In Greece all things are at once old and new. As, in physical organisms, the actual particles of matter have existed long before in other combinations; and what is really new in a new organism is the new cohering force--the mode of life,--so, in the products of Greek civilisation, the actual elements are traceable elsewhere by antiquarians who care to trace them; the elements, for instance, of its peculiar national [216] architecture. Yet all is also emphatically autochthonous, as the Greeks said, new-born at home, by right of a new, informing, combining spirit playing over those mere elements, and touching them, above all, with a wonderful sense of the nature and destiny of man--the dignity of his soul and of his body--so that in all things the Greeks are as discoverers. Still, the original and primary motive seems, in matters of art, to have come from without; and the view to which actual discovery and all true analogies more and more point is that of a connexion of the origin of Greek art, ultimately with Assyria, proximately with Phoenicia, partly through Asia Minor, and chiefly through Cyprus--an original connexion again and again re-asserted, like a surviving trick of inheritance, as in later times it came in contact with the civilisation of Caria and Lycia, old affinities being here linked anew; and with a certain Asiatic tradition, of which one representative is the Ionic style of architecture, traceable all through Greek art--an Asiatic curiousness, or poikilia,+ strongest in that heroic age of which I have been speaking, and distinguishing some schools and masters in Greece more than others; and always in appreciable distinction from the more clearly defined and self-asserted Hellenic influence. Homer himself witnesses to the intercourse, through early, adventurous commerce, as in the bright and animated picture with which [217] the history of Herodotus begins, between the Greeks and Eastern countries. We may, perhaps, forget sometimes, thinking over the greatness of its place in the history of civilisation, how small a country Greece really was; how short the distances upwards, from island to island, to the coast of Asia, so that we can hardly make a sharp separation between Asia and Greece, nor deny, besides great and palpable acts of importation, all sorts of impalpable Asiatic influences, by way alike of attraction and repulsion, upon Greek manners and taste. Homer, as we saw, was right in making Troy essentially a Greek city, with inhabitants superior in all culture to their kinsmen on the Western shore, and perhaps proportionally weaker on the practical or moral side, and with an element of languid Ionian voluptuousness in them, typified by the cedar and gold of the chamber of Paris--an element which the austere, more strictly European influence of the Dorian Apollo will one day correct in all genuine Greeks. The Aegean, with its islands, is, then, a bond of union, not a barrier; and we must think of Greece, as has been rightly said, as its whole continuous shore. The characteristics of Greek art, indeed, in the heroic age, so far as we can discern them, are those also of Phoenician art, its delight in metal among the rest, of metal especially as an element in architecture, the covering of everything with plates of metal. It was from [218] Phoenicia that the costly material in which early Greek art delighted actually came--ivory, amber, much of the precious metals. These the adventurous Phoenician traders brought in return for the mussel which contained the famous purple, in quest of which they penetrated far into all the Greek havens. Recent discoveries present the island of Cyprus, the great source of copper and copper- work in ancient times, as the special mediator between the art of Phoenicia and Greece; and in some archaic figures of Aphrodite with her dove, brought from Cyprus and now in the British Museum--objects you might think, at first sight, taken from the niches of a French Gothic cathedral--are some of the beginnings, at least, of Greek sculpture manifestly under the influence of Phoenician masters. And, again, mythology is the reflex of characteristic facts. It is through Cyprus that the religion of Aphrodite comes from Phoenicia to Greece. Here, in Cyprus, she is connected with some other kindred elements of mythological tradition, above all with the beautiful old story of Pygmalion, in which the thoughts of art and love are connected so closely together. First of all, on the prows of the Phoenician ships, the tutelary image of Aphrodite Euploea, the protectress of sailors, comes to Cyprus--to Cythera; it is in this simplest sense that she is, primarily, Anadyomene.+ And her connexion [219] with the arts is always an intimate one. In Cyprus her worship is connected with an architecture, not colossal, but full of dainty splendour--the art of the shrine-maker, the maker of reliquaries; the art of the toilet, the toilet of Aphrodite; the Homeric hymn to Aphrodite is full of all that; delight in which we have seen to be characteristic of the true Homer. And now we see why Hephaestus, that crook-backed and uncomely god, is the husband of Aphrodite. Hephaestus is the god of fire, indeed; as fire he is flung from heaven by Zeus; and in the marvellous contest between Achilles and the river Xanthus in the twenty-first book of the Iliad, he intervenes in favour of the hero, as mere fire against water. But he soon ceases to be thus generally representative of the functions of fire, and becomes almost exclusively representative of one only of its aspects, its function, namely, in regard to early art; he becomes the patron of smiths, bent with his labour at the forge, as people had seen such real workers; he is the most perfectly developed of all the Daedali, Mulcibers, or Cabeiri. That the god of fire becomes the god of all art, architecture included, so that he makes the houses of the gods, and is also the husband of Aphrodite, marks a threefold group of facts; the prominence, first, of a peculiar kind of art in early Greece, that beautiful metal-work, with [220] which he is bound and bent; secondly, the connexion of this, through Aphrodite, with an almost wanton personal splendour; the connexion, thirdly, of all this with Cyprus and Phoenicia, whence, literally, Aphrodite comes. Hephaestus is the \"spiritual form\" of the Asiatic element in Greek art. This, then, is the situation which the first period of Greek art comprehends; a people whose civilisation is still young, delighting, as the young do, in ornament, in the sensuous beauty of ivory and gold, in all the lovely productions of skilled fingers. They receive all this, together with the worship of Aphrodite, by way of Cyprus, from Phoenicia, from the older, decrepit Eastern civilisation, itself long since surfeited with that splendour; and they receive it in frugal quantity, so frugal that their thoughts always go back to the East, where there is the fulness of it, as to a wonder-land of art. Received thus in frugal quantity, through many generations, that world of Asiatic tectonics stimulates the sensuous capacity in them, accustoms the hand to produce and the eye to appreciate the more delicately enjoyable qualities of material things. But nowhere in all this various and exquisite world of design is there as yet any adequate sense of man himself, nowhere is there an insight into or power over human form as the expression of human soul. Yet those arts of design in which that younger people delights [221] have in them already, as designed work, that spirit of reasonable order, that expressive congruity in the adaptation of means to ends, of which the fully developed admirableness of human form is but the consummation-- a consummation already anticipated in the grand and animated figures of epic poetry, their power of thought, their laughter and tears. Under the hands of that younger people, as they imitate and pass largely and freely beyond those older craftsmen, the fire of the reasonable soul will kindle, little by little, up to the Theseus of the Parthenon and the Venus of Melos. The ideal aim of Greek sculpture, as of all other art, is to deal, indeed, with the deepest elements of man's nature and destiny, to command and express these, but to deal with them in a manner, and with a kind of expression, as clear and graceful and simple, if it may be, as that of the Japanese flower-painter. And what the student of Greek sculpture has to cultivate generally in himself is the capacity for appreciating the expression of thought in outward form, the constant habit of associating sense with soul, of tracing what we call expression to its sources. But, concurrently with this, he must also cultivate, all along, a not less equally constant appreciation of intelligent workmanship in work, and of design in things designed, of the rational control of matter everywhere. From many sources he may feed this sense of intelligence [222] and design in the productions of the minor crafts, above all in the various and exquisite art of Japan. Carrying a delicacy like that of nature itself into every form of imitation, reproduction, and combination-- leaf and flower, fish and bird, reed and water--and failing only when it touches the sacred human form, that art of Japan is not so unlike the earliest stages of Greek art as might at first sight be supposed. We have here, and in no mere fragments, the spectacle of a universal application to the instruments of daily life of fitness and beauty, in a temper still unsophisticated, as also unelevated, by the divination of the spirit of man. And at least the student must always remember that Greek art was throughout a much richer and warmer thing, at once with more shadows, and more of a dim magnificence in its surroundings, than the illustrations of a classical dictionary might induce him to think. Some of the ancient temples of Greece were as rich in aesthetic curiosities as a famous modern museum. That Asiatic poikilia,+ that spirit of minute and curious loveliness, follows the bolder imaginative efforts of Greek art all through its history, and one can hardly be too careful in keeping up the sense of this daintiness of execution through the entire course of its development. It is not only that the minute object of art, the tiny vase-painting, intaglio, coin, or cameo, often reduces into the palm of the hand lines grander than those of [223] many a life-sized or colossal figure; but there is also a sense in which it may be said that the Venus of Melos, for instance, is but a supremely well-executed object of vertu, in the most limited sense of the term. Those solemn images of the temple of Theseus are a perfect embodiment of the human ideal, of the reasonable soul and of a spiritual world; they are also the best made things of their kind, as an urn or a cup is well made. A perfect, many-sided development of tectonic crafts, a state such as the art of some nations has ended in, becomes for the Greeks a mere opportunity, a mere starting-ground for their imaginative presentment of man, moral and inspired. A world of material splendour, moulded clay, beaten gold, polished stone;--the informing, reasonable soul entering into that, reclaiming the metal and stone and clay, till they are as full of living breath as the real warm body itself; the presence of those two elements is continuous throughout the fortunes of Greek art after the heroic age, and the constant right estimate of their action and reaction, from period to period, its true philosophy.

BEGINNINGS OF GREEK SCULPTURE II: THE AGE OF GRAVEN IMAGES [224] CRITICS of Greek sculpture have often spoken of it as if it had been always work in colourless stone, against an almost colourless background. Its real background, as I have tried to show, was a world of exquisite craftsmanship, touching the minutest details of daily life with splendour and skill, in close correspondence with a peculiarly animated development of human existence--the energetic movement and stir of typically noble human forms, quite worthily clothed--amid scenery as poetic as Titian's. If shapes of colourless stone did come into that background, it was as the undraped human form comes into some of Titian's pictures, only to cool and solemnise its splendour; the work of the Greek sculptor being seldom in quite colourless stone, nor always or chiefly in fastidiously selected marble even, but often in richly toned metal (this or that sculptor preferring some special variety of the bronze he worked in, such as the [225] hepatizôn or liver-coloured bronze, or the bright golden alloy of Corinth), and in its consummate products chryselephantine,--work in gold and ivory, on a core of cedar. Pheidias, in the Olympian Zeus, in the Athene of the Parthenon, fulfils what that primitive, heroic goldsmiths' age, dimly discerned in Homer, already delighted in; and the celebrated work of which I have first to speak now, and with which Greek sculpture emerges from that half-mythical age and becomes in a certain sense historical, is a link in that goldsmiths' or chryselephantine tradition, carrying us forwards to the work of Pheidias, backwards to the elaborate Asiatic furniture of the chamber of Paris. When Pausanias visited Olympia, towards the end of the second century after Christ, he beheld, among other precious objects in the temple of Here, a splendidly wrought treasure-chest of cedar-wood, in which, according to a legend, quick as usual with the true human colouring, the mother of Cypselus had hidden him, when a child, from the enmity of her family, the Bacchiadae, then the nobility of Corinth. The child, named Cypselus after this incident (Cypsele being a Corinthian word for chest), became tyrant of Corinth, and his grateful descendants, as it was said, offered the beautiful old chest to the temple of Here, as a memorial of his preservation. That would have been not long after the year 625 B.C. So much for the [226] story which Pausanias heard--but inherent probability, and some points of detail in his description, tend to fix the origin of the chest at a date at least somewhat later; and as Herodotus, telling the story of the concealment of Cypselus, does not mention the dedication of the chest at Olympia at all, it may perhaps have been only one of many later imitations of antique art. But, whatever its date, Pausanias certainly saw the thing, and has left a long description of it, and we may trust his judgment at least as to its archaic style. We have here, then, something plainly visible at a comparatively recent date, something quite different from those perhaps wholly mythical objects described in Homer,--an object which seemed to so experienced an observer as Pausanias an actual work of earliest Greek art. Relatively to later Greek art, it may have seemed to him, what the ancient bronze doors with their Scripture histories, which we may still see in the south transept of the cathedral of Pisa, are to later Italian art. Pausanias tells us nothing as to its size, nor directly as to its shape. It may, for anything he says, have been oval, but it was probably rectangular, with a broad front and two narrow sides, standing, as the maker of it had designed, against the wall; for, in enumerating the various subjects wrought upon it, in five rows one above another, he seems to proceed, beginning at the bottom on the right-hand side, along the front [227] from right to left, and then back again, through the second row from left to right, and, alternating thus, upwards to the last subject, at the top, on the left-hand side. The subjects represented, most of which had their legends attached in difficult archaic writing, were taken freely, though probably with a leading idea, out of various poetic cycles, as treated in the works of those so-called cyclic poets, who continued the Homeric tradition. Pausanias speaks, as Homer does in his description of the shield of Achilles, of a kind and amount of expression in feature and gesture certainly beyond the compass of any early art, and we may believe we have in these touches only what the visitor heard from enthusiastic exegetae, the interpreters or sacristans; though any one who has seen the Bayeux tapestry, for instance, must recognise the pathos and energy of which, when really prompted by genius, even the earliest hand is capable. Some ingenious attempts have been made to restore the grouping of the scenes, with a certain formal expansion or balancing of subjects, their figures and dimensions, in true Assyrian manner, on the front and sides. We notice some fine emblematic figures, the germs of great artistic motives in after times, already playing their parts there,--Death, and Sleep, and Night. \"There was a woman supporting on her right arm a white child sleeping; and on the other arm she held a dark child, as if asleep; [228] and they lay with their feet crossed. And the inscription shows, what might be understood without it, that they are Death and Sleep, and Night, the nurse of both of them.\" But what is most noticeable is, as I have already said, that this work, like the chamber of Paris, like the Zeus of Pheidias, is chryselephantine, its main fabric cedar, and the figures upon it partly of ivory, partly of gold,* but (and this is the most peculiar characteristic of its style) partly wrought out of the wood of the chest itself. And, as we read the description, we can hardly help distributing in fancy gold and ivory, respectively, to their appropriate functions in the representation. The cup of Dionysus, and the wings of certain horses there, Pausanias himself tells us were golden. Were not the apples of the Hesperides, the necklace of Eriphyle, the bridles, the armour, the unsheathed sword in the hand of Amphiaraus, also of gold? Were not the other children, like the white image of Sleep, especially the naked child Alcmaeon, of ivory? with Alcestis and Helen, and that one of the Dioscuri whose beard was still ungrown? Were not ivory and gold, again, combined in the throne of Hercules, and in the three goddesses conducted before Paris? The \"chest of Cypselus\" fitly introduces the first historical period of Greek art, a period [229] coming down to about the year 560 B.C., and the government of Pisistratus at Athens; a period of tyrants like Cypselus and Pisistratus himself, men of strong, sometimes unscrupulous individuality, but often also acute and cultivated patrons of the arts. It begins with a series of inventions, one here and another there,--inventions still for the most part technical, but which are attached to single names; for, with the growth of art, the influence of individuals, gifted for the opening of new ways, more and more defines itself; and the school, open to all comers, from which in turn the disciples may pass to all parts of Greece, takes the place of the family, in which the knowledge of art descends as a tradition from father to son, or of the mere trade-guild. Of these early industries we know little but the stray notices of Pausanias, often ambiguous, always of doubtful credibility. What we do see, through these imperfect notices, is a real period of animated artistic activity, richly rewarded. Byzes of Naxos, for instance, is recorded as having first adopted the plan of sawing marble into thin plates for use on the roofs of temples instead of tiles; and that his name has come down to us at all, testifies to the impression this fair white surface made on its first spectators. Various islands of the Aegean become each the source of some new artistic device. It is a period still under the reign of Hephaestus, delighting, above all, in magnificent [230] metal-work. \"The Samians,\" says Herodotus, \"out of a tenth part of their profits--a sum of six talents--caused a mixing vessel of bronze to be made, after the Argolic fashion; around it are projections of griffins' heads; and they dedicated it in the temple of Here, placing beneath it three colossal figures of bronze, seven cubits in height, leaning upon their knees.\" That was in the thirty-seventh Olympiad, and may be regarded as characteristic of the age. For the popular imagination, a kind of glamour, some mysterious connexion of the thing with human fortunes, still attaches to the curious product of artistic hands, to the ring of Polycrates, for instance, with its early specimen of engraved smaragdus, as to the mythical necklace of Harmonia. Pheidon of Argos first makes coined money, and the obelisci--the old nail-shaped iron money, now disused- -are hung up in the temple of Here; for, even thus early, the temples are in the way of becoming museums. Names like those of Eucheir and Eugrammus, who were said to have taken the art of baking clay vases from Samos to Etruria, have still a legendary air, yet may be real surnames; as in the case of Smilis, whose name is derived from a graver's tool, and who made the ancient image of Here at Samos. Corinth--mater statuariae--becomes a great nursery of art at an early time. Some time before the twenty-ninth Olympiad, Butades of Sicyon, the potter, settled there. The record of [231] early inventions in Greece is sometimes fondly coloured with human sentiment or incident. It is on the butterfly wing of such an incident--the love-sick daughter of the artist, who outlines on the wall the profile of her lover as he sleeps in the lamplight, to keep by her in absence--that the name of Butades the potter has come down to us. The father fills up the outline, long preserved, it was believed, in the Nymphaeum at Corinth, and hence the art of modelling from the life in clay. He learns, further, a way of colouring his clay red, and fixes his masks along the temple eaves. The temple of Athene Chalcioecus--Athene of the brazen house--at Sparta, the work of Gitiades, celebrated about this time as architect, statuary, and poet; who made, besides the image in her shrine, and besides other Dorian songs, a hymn to the goddess--was so called from its crust or lining of bronze plates, setting forth, in richly embossed imagery, various subjects of ancient legend. What Pausanias, who saw it, describes, is like an elaborate development of that method of covering the interiors of stone buildings with metal plates, of which the \"Treasury\" at Mycenae is the earliest historical, and the house of Alcinous the heroic, type. In the pages of Pausanias, that glitter, \"as of the moon or the sun,\" which Ulysses stood still to wonder at, may still be felt. And on the right hand of this \"brazen house,\" he tells us, stood an [232] image of Zeus, also of bronze, the most ancient of all images of bronze. This had not been cast, nor wrought out of a single mass of metal, but, the various parts having been finished separately (probably beaten to shape with the hammer over a wooden mould), had been fitted together with nails or rivets. That was the earliest method of uniting the various parts of a work in metal--image, or vessel, or breastplate--a method allowing of much dainty handling of the cunning pins and rivets, and one which has its place still, in perfectly accomplished metal-work, as in the equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Coleoni, by Andrea Verrocchio, in the piazza of St. John and St. Paul at Venice. In the British Museum there is a very early specimen of it,--a large egg-shaped vessel, fitted together of several pieces, the projecting pins or rivets, forming a sort of diadem round the middle, being still sharp in form and heavily gilt. That method gave place in time to a defter means of joining the parts together, with more perfect unity and smoothness of surface, the art of soldering; and the invention of this art--of soldering iron, in the first instance--is coupled with the name of Glaucus of Chios, a name which, in connexion with this and other devices for facilitating the mechanical processes of art,--for perfecting artistic effect with economy of labour--became proverbial, the \"art of Glaucus\" being attributed to those who work well with rapidity and ease. [233] Far more fruitful still was the invention of casting, of casting hollow figures especially, attributed to Rhoecus and Theodorus, architects of the great temple at Samos. Such hollow figures, able, in consequence of their lightness, to rest, almost like an inflated bladder, on a single point--the entire bulk of a heroic rider, for instance, on the point of his horse's tail--admit of a much freer distribution of the whole weight or mass required, than is possible in any other mode of statuary; and the invention of the art of casting is really the discovery of liberty in composition.* And, at last, about the year 576 B.C., we come to the first true school of sculptors, the first clear example, as we seem to discern, of a communicable style, reflecting and interpreting some real individuality (the double personality, in this case, of two brothers) in the masters who evolved it, conveyed to disciples who came to acquire it from distant places, and taking root through them at various centres, where the names of the [234] masters became attached, of course,. to many fair works really by the hands of the pupils. Dipoenus and Scyllis, these first true masters, were born in Crete; but their work is connected mainly with Sicyon, at that time the chief seat of Greek art. \"In consequence of some injury done them,\" it is said, \"while employed there upon certain sacred images, they departed to another place, leaving their work unfinished; and, not long afterwards, a grievous famine fell upon Sicyon. Thereupon, the people of Sicyon, inquiring of the Pythian Apollo how they might be relieved, it was answered them, 'if Dipoenus and Scyllis should finish those images of the gods'; which thing the Sicyonians obtained from them, humbly, at a great price.\" That story too, as we shall see, illustrates the spirit of the age. For their sculpture they used the white marble of Paros, being workers in marble especially, though they worked also in ebony and in ivory, and made use of gilding. \"Figures of cedar-wood, partly incrusted with gold\"--kedrou zôdia chrysô diênthismena+--Pausanias says exquisitely, describing a certain work of their pupil, Dontas of Lacedaemon. It is to that that we have definitely come at last, in the school of Dipoenus and Scyllis. Dry and brief as these details may seem, they are the witness to an active, eager, animated period of inventions and beginnings, in which the Greek workman triumphs over the first [235] rough mechanical difficulties which beset him in the endeavour to record what his soul conceived of the form of priest or athlete then alive upon the earth, or of the ever-living gods, then already more seldom seen upon it. Our own fancy must fill up the story of the unrecorded patience of the workshop, into which we seem to peep through these scanty notices--the fatigue, the disappointments, the steps repeated, ending at last in that moment of success, which is all Pausanias records, somewhat uncertainly. And as this period begins with the chest of Cypselus, so it ends with a work in some respects similar, also seen and described by Pausanias--the throne, as he calls it, of the Amyclaean Apollo. It was the work of a well-known artist, Bathycles of Magnesia, who, probably about the year 550 B.C., with a company of workmen, came to the little ancient town of Amyclae, near Sparta, a place full of traditions of the heroic age. He had been invited thither to perform a peculiar task--the construction of a throne; not like the throne of the Olympian Zeus, and others numerous in after times, for a seated figure, but for the image of the local Apollo; no other than a rude and very ancient pillar of bronze, thirty cubits high, to which, Hermes-wise, head, arms, and feet were attached. The thing stood upright, as on a base, upon a kind of tomb or reliquary, in which, according to tradition, lay the remains of the young prince [236] Hyacinth, son of the founder of that place, beloved by Apollo for his beauty, and accidentally struck dead by him in play, with a quoit. From the drops of the lad's blood had sprung up the purple flower of his name, which bears on its petals the letters of the ejaculation of woe; and in his memory the famous games of Amyclae were celebrated, beginning about the time of the longest day, when the flowers are stricken by the sun and begin to fade--a festival marked, amid all its splendour, with some real melancholy, and serious thought of the dead. In the midst of the \"throne\" of Bathycles, this sacred receptacle, with the strange, half-humanised pillar above it, was to stand, probably in the open air, within a consecrated enclosure. Like the chest of Cypselus, the throne was decorated with reliefs of subjects taken from epic poetry, and it had supporting figures. Unfortunately, what Pausanias tells us of this monument hardly enables one to present it to the imagination with any completeness or certainty; its dimensions he himself was unable exactly to ascertain, and he does not tell us its material. There are reasons, however, for supposing that it was of metal; and amid these ambiguities, the decorations of its base, the grave or altar-tomb of Hyacinth, shine out clearly, and are also, for the most part, clear in their significance. \"There are wrought upon the altar figures, on the one side of Biris, on the other of [237] Amphitrite and Poseidon. Near Zeus and Hermes, in speech with each other, stand Dionysus and Semele, and, beside her, Ino. Demeter, Kore, and Pluto are also wrought upon it, the Fates and the Seasons above them, and with them Aphrodite, Athene, and Artemis. They are conducting Hyacinthus to heaven, with Polyboea, the sister of Hyacinthus, who died, as is told, while yet a virgin. . . . Hercules also is figured on the tomb; he too carried to heaven by Athene and the other gods. The daughters of Thestius also are upon the altar, and the Seasons again, and the Muses.\" It was as if many lines of solemn thought had been meant to unite, about the resting-place of this local Adonis, in imageries full of some dim promise of immortal life. But it was not so much in care for old idols as in the making of new ones that Greek art was at this time engaged. This whole first period of Greek art might, indeed, be called the period of graven images, and all its workmen sons of Daedalus; for Daedalus is the mythical, or all but mythical, representative of all those arts which are combined in the making of lovelier idols than had heretofore been seen. The old Greek word which is at the root of the name Daedalus,+ the name of a craft rather than a proper name, probably means to work curiously--all curiously beautiful wood-work is Daedal work; the main point about the curiously beautiful [238] chamber in which Nausicaa sleeps, in the Odyssey, being that, like some exquisite Swiss châlet, it is wrought in wood. But it came about that those workers in wood, whom Daedalus represents, the early craftsmen of Crete especially, were chiefly concerned with the making of religious images, like the carvers of Berchtesgaden and Oberammergau, the sort of daintily finished images of the objects of public or private devotion which such workmen would turn out. Wherever there was a wooden idol in any way fairer than others, finished, perhaps, sometimes, with colour and gilding, and appropriate real dress, there the hand of Daedalus had been. That such images were quite detached from pillar or wall, that they stood free, and were statues in the proper sense, showed that Greek art was already liberated from its earlier Eastern associations; such free-standing being apparently unknown in Assyrian art. And then, the effect of this Daedal skill in them was, that they came nearer to the proper form of humanity. It is the wonderful life-likeness of these early images which tradition celebrates in many anecdotes, showing a very early instinctive turn for, and delight in naturalism, in the Greek temper. As Cimabue, in his day, was able to charm men, almost as with illusion, by the simple device of half-closing the eyelids of his personages, and giving them, instead of round eyes, eyes that seemed to be in some degree sentient, and to feel [239] the light; so the marvellous progress in those Daedal wooden images was, that the eyes were open, so that they seemed to look,--the feet separated, so that they seemed to walk. Greek art is thus, almost from the first, essentially distinguished from the art of Egypt, by an energetic striving after truth in organic form. In representing the human figure, Egyptian art had held by mathematical or mechanical proportions exclusively. The Greek apprehends of it, as the main truth, that it is a living organism, with freedom of movement, and hence the infinite possibilities of motion, and of expression by motion, with which the imagination credits the higher sort of Greek sculpture; while the figures of Egyptian art, graceful as they often are, seem absolutely incapable of any motion or gesture, other than the one actually designed. The work of the Greek sculptor, together with its more real anatomy, becomes full also of human soul. That old, primitive, mystical, first period of Greek religion, with its profound, though half-conscious, intuitions of spiritual powers in the natural world, attaching itself not to the worship of visible human forms, but to relics, to natural or half-natural objects--the roughly hewn tree, the unwrought stone, the pillar, the holy cone of Aphrodite in her dimly-lighted cell at Paphos--had passed away. The second stage in the development of Greek religion had come; a [240] period in which poet and artist were busily engaged in the work of incorporating all that might be retained of the vague divinations of that earlier visionary time, in definite and intelligible human image and human story. The vague belief, the mysterious custom and tradition, develope themselves into an elaborately ordered ritual-- into personal gods, imaged in ivory and gold, sitting on beautiful thrones. Always, wherever a shrine or temple, great or small, is mentioned, there, we may conclude, was a visible idol, there was conceived to be the actual dwelling-place of a god. And this understanding became not less but more definite, as the temple became larger and more splendid, full of ceremony and servants, like the abode of an earthly king, and as the sacred presence itself assumed, little by little, the last beauties and refinements of the visible human form and expression. In what we have seen of this first period of Greek art, in all its curious essays and inventions, we may observe this demand for beautiful idols increasing in Greece--for sacred images, at first still rude, and in some degree the holier for their rudeness, but which yet constitute the beginnings of the religious style, consummate in the work of Pheidias, uniting the veritable image of man in the full possession of his reasonable soul, with the true religious mysticity, the signature there of something from afar. One by one these [241] new gods of bronze, or marble, or flesh-like ivory, take their thrones, at this or that famous shrine, like the images of this period which Pausanias saw in the temple of Here at Olympia--the throned Seasons, with Themis as the mother of the Seasons (divine rectitude being still blended, in men's fancies, with the unchanging physical order of things) and Fortune, and Victory \"having wings,\" and Kore and Demeter and Dionysus, already visibly there, around the image of Here herself, seated on a throne; and all chryselephantine, all in gold and ivory. Novel as these things are, they still undergo consecration at their first erecting. The figure of Athene, in her brazen temple at Sparta, the work of Gitiades, who makes also the image and the hymn, in triple service to the goddess; and again, that curious story of Dipoenus and Scyllis, brought back with so much awe to remove the public curse by completing their sacred task upon the images, show how simply religious the age still was--that this widespread artistic activity was a religious enthusiasm also; those early sculptors have still, for their contemporaries, a divine mission, with some kind of hieratic or sacred quality in their gift, distinctly felt. The development of the artist, in the proper sense, out of the mere craftsman, effected in the first division of this period, is now complete; and, in close connexion with that busy graving of religious images, which occupies its second [242] division, we come to something like real personalities, to men with individual characteristics--such men as Ageladas of Argos, Callon and Onatas of Aegina, and Canachus of Sicyon. Mere fragment as our information concerning these early masters is at the best, it is at least unmistakeably information about men with personal differences of temper and talent, of their motives, of what we call style. We have come to a sort of art which is no longer broadly characteristic of a general period, one whose products we might have looked at without its occurring to us to ask concerning the artist, his antecedents, and his school. We have to do now with types of art, fully impressed with the subjectivity, the intimacies of the artist. Among these freer and stronger personalities emerging thus about the beginning of the fifth century before Christ--about the period of the Persian war--the name to which most of this sort of personal quality attaches, and which is therefore very interesting, is the name of Canachus of Sicyon, who seems to have comprehended in himself all the various attainments in art which had been gradually developed in the schools of his native city--carver in wood, sculptor, brass-cutter, and toreutes; by toreuticê+ being meant the whole art of statuary in metals, and in their combination with other materials. At last we seem to see an actual person at work, and to some degree can follow, with natural curiosity, [243] the motions of his spirit and his hand. We seem to discern in all we know of his productions the results of individual apprehension--the results, as well as the limitations, of an individual talent. It is impossible to date exactly the chief period of the activity of Canachus. That the great image of Apollo, which he made for the Milesians, was carried away to Ecbatana by the Persian army, is stated by Pausanias; but there is a doubt whether this was under Xerxes, as Pausanias says, in the year 479 B.C., or twenty years earlier, under Darius. So important a work as this colossal image of Apollo, for so great a shrine as the Didymaeum, was probably the task of his maturity; and his career may, therefore, be regarded as having begun, at any rate, prior to the year 479 B.C., and the end of the Persian invasion the event which may be said to close this period of art. On the whole, the chief period of his activity is thought to have fallen earlier, and to have occupied the last forty years of the previous century; and he would thus have flourished, as we say, about fifty years before the manhood of Pheidias, as Mino of Fiesole fifty years before the manhood of Michelangelo. His chief works were an Aphrodite, wrought for the Sicyonians in ivory and gold; that Apollo of bronze carried away by the Persians, and restored to its place about the year B.C. 350; and a reproduction of the same work in cedar-wood [244], for the sanctuary of Apollo of the Ismenus, at Thebes. The primitive Greek worship, as we may trace it in Homer, presents already, on a minor scale, all the essential characteristics of the most elaborate Greek worship of after times-- the sacred enclosure, the incense and other offerings, the prayer of the priest, the shrine itself--a small one, roofed in by the priest with green boughs, not unlike a wayside chapel in modern times, and understood to be the dwelling-place of the divine person--within, almost certainly, an idol, with its own sacred apparel, a visible form, little more than symbolical perhaps, like the sacred pillar for which Bathycles made his throne at Amyclae, but, if an actual image, certainly a rude one. That primitive worship, traceable in almost all these particulars, even in the first book of the Iliad, had given place, before the time of Canachus at Sicyon, to a more elaborate ritual and a more completely designed image-work; and a little bronze statue, discovered on the site of Tenea, where Apollo was the chief object of worship,* the best representative of many similar marble figures-- those of Thera and Orchomenus, for instance--is supposed to represent Apollo as this still early age conceived him--youthful, naked, muscular, and with the germ of the Greek profile, but formally smiling, and with a formal diadem or fillet, over the long hair which [245] shows him to be no mortal athlete. The hands, like the feet, excellently modelled, are here extended downwards at the sides; but in some similar figures the hands are lifted, and held straight outwards, with the palms upturned. The Apollo of Canachus also had the hands thus raised, and on the open palm of the right hand was placed a stag, while with the left he grasped the bow. Pliny says that the stag was an automaton, with a mechanical device for setting it in motion, a detail which hints, at least, at the subtlety of workmanship with which those ancient critics, who had opportunity of knowing, credited this early artist. Of this work itself nothing remains, but we possess perhaps some imitations of it. It is probably this most sacred possession of the place which the coins of Miletus display from various points of view, though, of course, only on the smallest scale. But a little bronze figure in the British Museum, with the stag in the right hand, and in the closed left hand the hollow where the bow has passed, is thought to have been derived from it; and its points of style are still further illustrated by a marble head of similar character, also preserved in the British Museum, which has many marks of having been copied in marble from an original in bronze. A really ancient work, or only archaic, it certainly expresses, together with all that careful patience and hardness of workmanship which is characteristic of an early age, a certain Apolline [246] strength--a pride and dignity in the features, so steadily composed, below the stiff, archaic arrangement of the long, fillet-bound locks. It is the exact expression of that midway position, between an involved, archaic stiffness and the free play of individual talent, which is attributed to Canachus by the ancients. His Apollo of cedar-wood, which inhabited a temple near the gates of Thebes, on a rising ground, below which flowed the river Ismenus, had, according to Pausanias, so close a resemblance to that at Miletus that it required little skill in one who had seen either of them to tell what master had designed the other. Still, though of the same dimensions, while one was of cedar the other was of bronze-- a reproduction one of the other we may believe, but with the modifications, according to the use of good workmen even so early as Canachus, due to the difference of the material. For the likeness between the two statues, it is to be observed, is not the mechanical likeness of those earlier images represented by the statuette of Tenea, which spoke, not of the style of one master, but only of the manufacture of one workshop. In those two images of Canachus--the Milesian Apollo and the Apollo of the Ismenus--there were resemblances amid differences; resemblances, as we may understand, in what was nevertheless peculiar, novel, and even innovating in the precise conception of the god therein set forth; [247] resemblances which spoke directly of a single workman, though working freely, of one hand and one fancy, a likeness in that which could by no means be truly copied by another; it was the beginning of what we mean by the style of a master. Together with all the novelty, the innovating and improving skill, which has made Canachus remembered, an attractive, old-world, deeply-felt mysticity seems still to cling about what we read of these early works. That piety, that religiousness of temper, of which the people of Sicyon had given proof so oddly in their dealings with those old carvers, Scyllis and Dipoenus, still survives in the master who was chosen to embody his own novelty of idea and execution in so sacred a place as the shrine of Apollo at Miletus. Something still conventional, combined, in these images, with the effect of great artistic skill, with a palpable beauty and power, seems to have given them a really imposing religious character. Escaping from the rigid uniformities of the stricter archaic style, he is still obedient to certain hieratic influences and traditions; he is still reserved, self-controlled, composed or even mannered a little, as in some sacred presence, with the severity and strength of the early style. But there are certain notices which seem to show that he had his purely poetical motives also, as befitted his age; motives which prompted works of mere fancy, like his Muse [248] with the Lyre, symbolising the chromatic style of music; Aristocles his brother, and Ageladas of Argos executing each another statue to symbolise the two other orders of music. The Riding Boys, of which Pliny speaks, like the mechanical stag on the hand of Apollo, which he also describes, were perhaps mechanical toys, as Benvenuto Cellini made toys. In the Beardless Aesculapius, again--the image of the god of healing, not merely as the son of Apollo, but as one ever young--it is the poetry of sculpture that we see. This poetic feeling, and the piety of temper so deeply impressed upon his images of Apollo, seem to have been combined in his chryselephantine Aphrodite, as we see it very distinctly in Pausanias, enthroned with an apple in one hand and a poppy in the other, and with the sphere, or polos, about the head, in its quaint little temple or chapel at Sicyon, with the hierokêpis, or holy garden, about it. This is what Canachus has to give us instead of the strange, symbolical cone, with the lights burning around it, in its dark cell--the form under which Aphrodite was worshipped at her famous shrine of Paphos. \"A woman to keep it fair,\" Pausanias tells us, \"who may go in to no man, and a virgin called the water-bearer, who holds her priesthood for a year, are alone permitted to enter the sacred place. All others may gaze upon the [249] goddess and offer their prayers from the doorway. The seated image is the work of Canachus of Sicyon. It is wrought in ivory and gold, bearing a sphere on the head, and having in the one hand a poppy and in the other an apple. They offer to her the thighs of all victims excepting swine, burning them upon sticks of juniper, together with leaves of lad's-love, a herb found in the enclosure without, and nowhere else in the world. Its leaves are smaller than those of the beech and larger than the ilex; in form they are like an oak-leaf, and in colour resemble most the leaves of the poplar, one side dusky, the other white.\" That is a place one would certainly have liked to see. So real it seems!--the seated image, the people gazing through the doorway, the fragrant odour. Must it not still be in secret keeping somewhere?-- we are almost tempted to ask; maintained by some few solitary worshippers, surviving from age to age, among the villagers of Achaia. In spite of many obscurities, it may be said that what we know, and what we do not know, of Canachus illustrates the amount and sort of knowledge we possess about the artists of the period which he best represents. A naïveté--a freshness, an early-aged simplicity and sincerity--that, we may believe, had we their works before us, would be for us their chief aesthetic charm. Cicero remarked that, in contrast with [250] the works of the next generation of sculptors, there was a stiffness in the statues of Canachus which made them seem untrue to nature--\"Canachi signa rigidiora esse quam ut imitentur veritatem.\" But Cicero belongs to an age surfeited with artistic licence, and likely enough to undervalue the severity of the early masters, the great motive struggling still with the minute and rigid hand. So the critics of the last century ignored, or underrated, the works of the earlier Tuscan sculptors. In what Cicero calls \"rigidity\" of Canachus, combined with what we seem to see of his poetry of conception, his freshness, his solemnity, we may understand no really repellent hardness, but only that earnest patience of labour, the expression of which is constant in all the best work of an early time, in the David of Verrocchio, for instance, and in the early Flemish painters, as it is natural and becoming in youth itself. The very touch of the struggling hand was upon the work; but with the interest, the half-repressed animation of a great promise, fulfilled, as we now see, in the magnificent growth of Greek sculpture in the succeeding age; which, however, for those earlier workmen, meant the loins girt and the half-folded wings not yet quite at home in the air, with a gravity, a discretion and reserve, the charm of which, if felt in quiet, is hardly less than that of the wealth and fulness of final mastery.

THE MARBLES OF AEGINA [251] I HAVE dwelt the more emphatically upon the purely sensuous aspects of early Greek art, on the beauty and charm of its mere material and workmanship, the grace of hand in it, its chryselephantine character, because the direction of all the more general criticism since Lessing has been, somewhat one-sidedly, towards the ideal or abstract element in Greek art, towards what we may call its philosophical aspect. And, indeed, this philosophical element, a tendency to the realisation of a certain inward, abstract, intellectual ideal, is also at work in Greek art--a tendency which, if that chryselephantine influence is called Ionian, may rightly be called the Dorian, or, in reference to its broader scope, the European influence; and this European influence or tendency is really towards the impression of an order, a sanity, a proportion in all work, which shall reflect the inward order of human reason, now fully conscious of itself,--towards a sort of art in which the record and delineation of humanity, as active in the wide, inward world of [252] its passion and thought, has become more or less definitely the aim of all artistic handicraft. In undergoing the action of these two opposing influences, and by harmonising in itself their antagonism, Greek sculpture does but reflect the larger movements of more general Greek history. All through Greek history we may trace, in every sphere of the activity of the Greek mind, the action of these two opposing tendencies,--the centrifugal and centripetal tendencies, as we may perhaps not too fancifully call them. There is the centrifugal, the Ionian, the Asiatic tendency, flying from the centre, working with little forethought straight before it, in the development of every thought and fancy; throwing itself forth in endless play of undirected imagination; delighting in brightness and colour, in beautiful material, in changeful form everywhere, in poetry, in philosophy, even in architecture and its subordinate crafts. In the social and political order it rejoices in the freest action of local and personal influences; its restless versatility drives it towards the assertion of the principles of separatism, of individualism--the separation of state from state, the maintenance of local religions, the development of the individual in that which is most peculiar and individual in him. Its claim is in its grace, its freedom and happiness, its lively interest, the variety of its gifts to civilisation; its weakness is self-evident, and was what made the unity of Greece impossible. [253] It is this centrifugal tendency which Plato is desirous to cure, by maintaining, over against it, the Dorian influence of a severe simplification everywhere, in society, in culture, in the very physical nature of man. An enemy everywhere to variegation, to what is cunning or \"myriad-minded,\" he sets himself, in mythology, in music, in poetry, in every kind of art, to enforce the ideal of a sort of Parmenidean abstractness and calm. This exaggerated ideal of Plato's is, however, only the exaggeration of that salutary European tendency, which, finding human mind the most absolutely real and precious thing in the world, enforces everywhere the impress of its sanity, its profound reflexions upon things as they really are, its sense of proportion. It is the centripetal tendency, which links individuals to each other, states to states, one period of organic growth to another, under the reign of a composed, rational, self-conscious order, in the universal light of the understanding. Whether or not this temper, so clearly traceable as a distinct influence in the course of Greek development, was indeed the peculiar gift of the Dorian race, certainly that race is the best illustration of it, in its love of order, of that severe composition everywhere, of which the Dorian style of architecture is, as it were, a material symbol--in its constant aspiration after what is earnest and dignified, as exemplified most evidently in the religion of its predilection, the religion of Apollo. [254] For as that Ionian influence, the chryselephantine influence, had its patron in Hephaestus, belonged to the religion of Hephaestus, husband of Aphrodite, the representation of exquisite workmanship, of fine art in metal, coming from the East in close connexion with the artificial furtherance, through dress and personal ornament, of the beauty of the body; so that Dorian or European influence embodied itself in the religion of Apollo. For the development of this or that mythological conception, from its root in fact or law of the physical world, is very various in its course. Thus, Demeter, the spirit of life in grass,--and Dionysus, the \"spiritual form\" of life in the green sap,- -remain, to the end of men's thoughts and fancies about them, almost wholly physical. But Apollo, the \"spiritual form\" of sunbeams, early becomes (the merely physical element in his constitution being almost wholly suppressed) exclusively ethical,--the \"spiritual form\" of inward or intellectual light, in all its manifestations. He represents all those specially European ideas, of a reasonable, personal freedom, as understood in Greece; of a reasonable polity; of the sanity of soul and body, through the cure of disease and of the sense of sin; of the perfecting of both by reasonable exercise or ascêsis; his religion is a sort of embodied equity, its aim the realisation of fair reason and just consideration of the truth of things everywhere. [255] I cannot dwell on the general aspects of this subject further, but I would remark that in art also the religion of Apollo was a sanction of, and an encouragement towards the true valuation of humanity, in its sanity, its proportion, its knowledge of itself. Following after this, Greek art attained, in its reproductions of human form, not merely to the profound expression of the highest indwelling spirit of human intelligence, but to the expression also of the great human passions, of the powerful movements as well as of the calm and peaceful order of the soul, as finding in the affections of the body a language, the elements of which the artist might analyse, and then combine, order, and recompose. In relation to music, to art, to all those matters over which the Muses preside, Apollo, as distinct from Hermes, seems to be the representative and patron of what I may call reasonable music, of a great intelligence at work in art, of beauty attained through the conscious realisation of ideas. They were the cities of the Dorian affinity which early brought to perfection that most characteristic of Greek institutions, the sacred dance, with the whole gymnastic system which was its natural accompaniment. And it was the familiar spectacle of that living sculpture which developed, perhaps, beyond everything else in the Greek mind, at its best, a sense of the beauty and significance of the human form. Into that bewildered, dazzling world of minute [256] and dainty handicraft--the chamber of Paris, the house of Alcinous--in which the form of man alone had no adequate place, and as yet, properly, was not, this Dorian, European, Apolline influence introduced the intelligent and spiritual human presence, and gave it its true value, a value consistently maintained to the end of Greek art, by a steady hold upon and preoccupation with the inward harmony and system of human personality. In the works of the Asiatic tradition--the marbles of Nineveh, for instance--and, so far as we can see, in the early Greek art, which derives from it, as, for example, in the archaic remains from Cyprus, the form of man is inadequate, and below the measure of perfection attained there in the representation of the lower forms of life; just as in the little reflective art of Japan, so lovely in its reproduction of flower or bird, the human form alone comes almost as a caricature, or is at least untouched by any higher ideal. To that Asiatic tradition, then, with its perfect craftsmanship, its consummate skill in design, its power of hand, the Dorian, the European, the true Hellenic influence brought a revelation of the soul and body of man. And we come at last in the marbles of Aegina to a monument, which bears upon it the full expression of this humanism,--to a work, in which the presence of man, realised with complete mastery of hand, and with clear apprehension of how he actually is and moves and looks, [257] is touched with the freshest sense of that new-found, inward value; the energy of worthy passions purifying, the light of his reason shining through, bodily forms and motions, solemnised, attractive, pathetic. We have reached an extant work, real and visible, of an importance out of all proportion to anything actually remaining of earlier art, and justifying, by its direct interest and charm, our long prelude on the beginnings of Greek sculpture, while there was still almost nothing actually to see. These fifteen figures of Parian marble, of about two-thirds the size of life, forming, with some deficiencies, the east and west gables of a temple of Athene, the ruins of which still stand on a hill-side by the sea-shore, in a remote part of the island of Aegina, were discovered in the year 1811, and having been purchased by the Crown Prince, afterwards King Louis I., of Bavaria, are now the great ornament of the Glyptothek, or Museum of Sculpture, at Munich. The group in each gable consisted of eleven figures; and of the fifteen larger figures discovered, five belong to the eastern, ten to the western gable, so that the western gable is complete with the exception of one figure, which should stand in the place to which, as the groups are arranged at Munich, the beautiful figure, bending down towards the fallen leader, has been actually transferred from the eastern gable; certain fragments showing that the lost figure [258] corresponded essentially to this, which has therefore been removed hither from its place in the less complete group to which it properly belongs. For there are two legitimate views or motives in the restoration of ancient sculpture, the antiquarian and the aesthetic, as they may be termed respectively; the former limiting itself to the bare presentation of what actually remains of the ancient work, braving all shock to living eyes from the mutilated nose or chin; while the latter, the aesthetic method, requires that, with the least possible addition or interference, by the most skilful living hand procurable, the object shall be made to please, or at least content the living eye seeking enjoyment and not a bare fact of science, in the spectacle of ancient art. This latter way of restoration,--the aesthetic way,--followed by the famous connoisseurs of the Renaissance, has been followed here; and the visitor to Munich actually sees the marbles of Aegina, as restored after a model by the tasteful hand of Thorwaldsen. Different views have, however, been maintained as to the right grouping of the figures; but the composition of the two groups was apparently similar, not only in general character but in a certain degree of correspondence of all the figures, each to each. And in both the subject is a combat,--a combat between Greeks and Asiatics concerning the body of a Greek hero, fallen among the foemen,--an incident so characteristic [259] of the poetry of the heroic wars. In both cases, Athene, whose temple this sculpture was designed to decorate, intervenes, her image being complete in the western gable, the head and some other fragments remaining of that in the eastern. The incidents represented were probably chosen with reference to the traditions of Aegina in connexion with the Trojan war. Greek legend is ever deeply coloured by local interest and sentiment, and this monument probably celebrates Telamon, and Ajax his son, the heroes who established the fame of Aegina, and whom the united Greeks, on the morning of the battle of Salamis, in which the Aeginetans were distinguished above all other Greeks in bravery, invited as their peculiar, spiritual allies from that island. Accordingly, antiquarians are, for the most part, of opinion that the eastern gable represents the combat of Hercules (Hercules being the only figure among the warriors certainly to be identified), and of his comrade Telamon, against Laomedon of Troy, in which, properly, Hercules was leader, but here, as squire and archer, is made to give the first place to Telamon, as the titular hero of the place. Opinion is not so definite regarding the subject of the western gable, which, however, probably represents the combat between the Greeks and Trojans over the body of Patroclus. In both cases an Aeginetan hero, in the eastern gable Telamon, in the western [260] his son Ajax, is represented in the extreme crisis of battle, such a crisis as, according to the deep religiousness of the Greeks of that age, was a motive for the visible intervention of the goddess in favour of her chosen people. Opinion as to the date of the work, based mainly on the characteristics of the work itself, has varied within a period ranging from the middle of the sixtieth to the middle of the seventieth Olympiad, inclining on the whole to the later date, in the period of the Ionian revolt against Persia, and a few years earlier than the battle of Marathon. In this monument, then, we have a revelation in the sphere of art, of the temper which made the victories of Marathon and Salamis possible, of the true spirit of Greek chivalry as displayed in the Persian war, and in the highly ideal conception of its events, expressed in Herodotus and approving itself minutely to the minds of the Greeks, as a series of affairs in which the gods and heroes of old time personally intervened, and that not as mere shadows. It was natural that the high-pitched temper, the stress of thought and feeling, which ended in the final conflict of Greek liberty with Asiatic barbarism, should stimulate quite a new interest in the poetic legends of the earlier conflict between them in the heroic age. As the events of the Crusades and the chivalrous spirit of that period, leading men's minds back to ponder over the deeds of [261] Charlemagne and his paladins, gave birth to the composition of the Song of Roland, just so this Aeginetan sculpture displays the Greeks of a later age feeding their enthusiasm on the legend of a distant past, and is a link between Herodotus and Homer. In those ideal figures, pensive a little from the first, we may suppose, with the shadowiness of a past age, we may yet see how Greeks of the time of Themistocles really conceived of Homeric knight and squire. Some other fragments of art, also discovered in Aegina, and supposed to be contemporary with the temple of Athene, tend, by their roughness and immaturity, to show that this small building, so united in its effect, so complete in its simplicity, in the symmetry of its two main groups of sculpture, was the perfect artistic flower of its time and place. Yet within the limits of this simple unity, so important an element in the charm and impressiveness of the place, a certain inequality of design and execution may be detected; the hand of a slightly earlier master, probably, having worked in the western gable, while the master of the eastern gable has gone some steps farther than he in fineness and power of expression; the stooping figure of the supposed Ajax,--belonging to the western group in the present arrangement, but really borrowed, as I said, from the eastern,--which has in it something above the type of the figures grouped round it, being this later sculptor's work. Yet Overbeck, [262] who has elaborated the points of this distinction of styles, commends without reserve the technical excellence of the whole work, executed, as he says, \"with an application of all known instruments of sculpture; the delicate calculation of weight in the composition of the several parts, allowing the artist to dispense with all artificial supports, and to set his figures, with all their complex motions, and yet with plinths only three inches thick, into the basis of the gable; the bold use of the chisel, which wrought the shield, on the freely-held arm, down to a thickness of scarcely three inches; the fineness of the execution even in parts of the work invisible to an ordinary spectator, in the diligent finishing of which the only motive of the artist was to satisfy his own conviction as to the nature of good sculpture.\" It was the Dorian cities, Plato tells us, which first shook off the false Asiatic shame, and stripped off their clothing for purposes of exercise and training in the gymnasium; and it was part of the Dorian or European influence to assert the value in art of the unveiled and healthy human form. And here the artists of Aegina, notwithstanding Homer's description of Greek armour, glowing like the sun itself, have displayed the Greek warriors--Greek and Trojan alike--not in the equipments they would really have worn, but naked,--flesh fairer than that golden armour, though more subdued and tranquil [263] in effect on the spectator, the undraped form of man coming like an embodiment of the Hellenic spirit, and as an element of temperance, into the somewhat gaudy spectacle of Asiatic, or archaic art. Paris alone bears his dainty trappings, characteristically,--a coat of golden scale-work, the scales set on a lining of canvas or leather, shifting deftly over the delicate body beneath, and represented on the gable by the gilding, or perhaps by real gilt metal. It was characteristic also of that more truly Hellenic art--another element of its temperance--to adopt the use of marble in its works; and the material of these figures is the white marble of Paros. Traces of colour have, however, been found on certain parts of them. The outer surfaces of the shields and helmets have been blue; their inner parts and the crests of the helmets, red; the hem of the drapery of Athene, the edges of her sandals, the plinths on which the figures stand, also red; one quiver red, another blue; the eyes and lips, too, coloured; perhaps, the hair. There was just a limited and conventionalised use of colour, in effect, upon the marble. And although the actual material of these figures is marble, its coolness and massiveness suiting the growing severity of Greek thought, yet they have their reminiscences of work in bronze, in a certain slimness and tenuity, a certain dainty lightness of poise in their grouping, which [264] remains in the memory as a peculiar note of their style; the possibility of such easy and graceful balancing being one of the privileges or opportunities of statuary in cast metal, of that hollow casting in which the whole weight of the work is so much less than that of a work of equal size in marble, and which permits so much wider and freer a disposition of the parts about its centre of gravity. In Aegina the tradition of metal-work seems to have been strong, and Onatas, whose name is closely connected with Aegina, and who is contemporary with the presumably later portion of this monument, was above all a worker in bronze. Here again, in this lurking spirit of metal-work, we have a new element of complexity in the character of these precious remains. And then, to compass the whole work in our imagination, we must conceive yet another element in the conjoint effect; metal being actually mingled with the marble, brought thus to its daintiest point of refinement, as the little holes indicate, bored into the marble figures for the attachment of certain accessories in bronze,--lances, swords, bows, the Medusa's head on the aegis of Athene, and its fringe of little snakes. And as there was no adequate consciousness and recognition of the essentials of man's nature in the older, oriental art, so there is no pathos, no humanity in the more special sense, but a kind of hardness and cruelty rather, in those oft-repeated, long, matter-of-fact processions, on the [265] marbles of Nineveh, of slave-like soldiers on their way to battle mechanically, or of captives on their way to slavery or death, for the satisfaction of the Great King. These Greek marbles, on the contrary, with that figure yearning forward so graciously to the fallen leader, are deeply impressed with a natural pathetic effect--the true reflexion again of the temper of Homer in speaking of war. Ares, the god of war himself, we must remember, is, according to his original import, the god of storms, of winter raging among the forests of the Thracian mountains, a brother of the north wind. It is only afterwards that, surviving many minor gods of war, he becomes a leader of hosts, a sort of divine knight and patron of knighthood; and, through the old intricate connexion of love and war, and that amorousness which is the universally conceded privilege of the soldier's life, he comes to be very near Aphrodite,--the paramour of the goddess of physical beauty. So that the idea of a sort of soft dalliance mingles, in his character, so unlike that of the Christian leader, Saint George, with the idea of savage, warlike impulses; the fair, soft creature suddenly raging like a storm, to which, in its various wild incidents, war is constantly likened in Homer; the effects of delicate youth and of tempest blending, in Ares, into one expression, not without that cruelty which mingles also, like the influence of some malign fate upon him, with the finer [266] characteristics of Achilles, who is a kind of merely human double of Ares. And in Homer's impressions of war the same elements are blent,--the delicacy, the beauty of youth, especially, which makes it so fit for purposes of love, spoiled and wasted by the random flood and fire of a violent tempest; the glittering beauty of the Greek \"war-men,\" expressed in so many brilliant figures, and the splendour of their equipments, in collision with the miserable accidents of battle, and the grotesque indignities of death in it, brought home to our fancy by a hundred pathetic incidents,--the sword hot with slaughter, the stifling blood in the throat, the spoiling of the body in every member severally. He thinks of, and records, at his early ending, the distant home from which the boy came, who goes stumbling now, just stricken so wretchedly, his bowels in his hands. He pushes the expression of this contrast to the macabre even, suggesting the approach of those lower forms of life which await to- morrow the fair bodies of the heroes, who strive and fall to-day like these in the Aeginetan gables. For it is just that two-fold sentiment which this sculpture has embodied. The seemingly stronger hand which wrought the eastern gable has shown itself strongest in the rigid expression of the truth of pain, in the mouth of the famous recumbent figure on the extreme left, the lips just open at the corner, and in the hard-shut lips of Hercules. Otherwise, [267] these figures all smile faintly, almost like the monumental effigies of the Middle Age, with a smile which, even if it be but a result of the mere conventionality of an art still somewhat immature, has just the pathetic effect of Homer's conventional epithet \"tender,\" when he speaks of the flesh of his heroes. And together with this touching power there is also in this work the effect of an early simplicity, the charm of its limitations. For as art which has passed its prime has sometimes the charm of an absolute refinement in taste and workmanship, so immature art also, as we now see, has its own attractiveness in the naïveté, the freshness of spirit, which finds power and interest in simple motives of feeling, and in the freshness of hand, which has a sense of enjoyment in mechanical processes still performed unmechanically, in the spending of care and intelligence on every touch. As regards Italian art, the sculpture and paintings of the earlier Renaissance, the aesthetic value of this naïveté is now well understood; but it has its value in Greek sculpture also. There, too, is a succession of phases through which the artistic power and purpose grew to maturity, with the enduring charm of an unconventional, unsophisticated freshness, in that very early stage of it illustrated by these marbles of Aegina, not less than in the work of Verrocchio and Mino of Fiesole. Effects of this we may note in that sculpture [268] of Aegina, not merely in the simplicity, or monotony even, of the whole composition, and in the exact and formal correspondence of one gable to the other, but in the simple readiness with which the designer makes the two second spearmen kneel, against the probability of the thing, so as just to fill the space he has to compose in. The profiles are still not yet of the fully developed Greek type, but have a somewhat sharp prominence of nose and chin, as in Etrurian design, in the early sculpture of Cyprus, and in the earlier Greek vases; and the general proportions of the body in relation to the shoulders are still somewhat archaically slim. But then the workman is at work in dry earnestness, with a sort of hard strength in detail, a scrupulousness verging on stiffness, like that of an early Flemish painter; he communicates to us his still youthful sense of pleasure in the experience of the first rudimentary difficulties of his art overcome. And withal, these figures have in them a true expression of life, of animation. In this monument of Greek chivalry, pensive and visionary as it may seem, those old Greek knights live with a truth like that of Homer or Chaucer. In a sort of stiff grace, combined with a sense of things bright or sorrowful directly felt, the Aeginetan workman is as it were the Chaucer of Greek sculpture. THE AGE OF ATHLETIC PRIZEMEN: A CHAPTER IN GREEK ART [269] IT is pleasant when, looking at medieval sculpture, we are reminded of that of Greece; pleasant likewise, conversely, in the study of Greek work to be put on thoughts of the Middle Age. To the refined intelligence, it would seem, there is something attractive in complex expression as such. The Marbles of Aegina, then, may remind us of the Middle Age where it passes into the early Renaissance, of its most tenderly finished warrior-tombs at Westminster or in Florence. A less mature phase of medieval art is recalled to our fancy by a primitive Greek work in the Museum of Athens, Hermes, bearing a ram, a little one, upon his shoulders. He bears it thus, had borne it round the walls of Tanagra, as its citizens told, by way of purifying that place from the plague, and brings to mind, of course, later images of the \"Good Shepherd.\" It is not the subject of the work, however, but its style, that sets us down in thought before some gothic [270] cathedral front. Suppose the Hermes Kriophorus lifted into one of those empty niches, and the archaeologist will inform you rightly, as at Auxerre or Wells, of Italian influence, perhaps of Italian workmen, and along with them indirect old Greek influence coming northwards; while the connoisseur assures us that all good art, at its respective stages of development, is in essential qualities everywhere alike. It is observed, as a note of imperfect skill, that in that carved block of stone the animal is insufficiently detached from the shoulders of its bearer. Again, how precisely gothic is the effect! Its very limitation as sculpture emphasises the function of the thing as an architectural ornament. And the student of the Middle Age, if it came within his range, would be right in so esteeming it. Hieratic, stiff and formal, if you will, there is a knowledge of the human body in it nevertheless, of the body, and of the purely animal soul therein, full of the promise of what is coming in that chapter of Greek art which may properly be entitled, \"The Age of Athletic Prizemen.\" That rude image, a work perhaps of Calamis of shadowy fame, belongs to a phase of art still in grave-clothes or swaddling-bands, still strictly subordinate to religious or other purposes not immediately its own. It had scarcely to wait for the next generation to be superseded, and we need not wonder that but little of it remains. But that it was a widely active phase of art, with [271] all the vigour of local varieties, is attested by another famous archaic monument, too full of a kind of sacred poetry to be passed by. The reader does not need to be reminded that the Greeks, vivid as was their consciousness of this life, cared much always for the graves of the dead; that to be cared for, to be honoured, in one's grave, to have tymbos amphipolos,+ a frequented tomb, as Pindar says, was a considerable motive with them, even among the young. In the study of its funeral monuments we might indeed follow closely enough the general development of art in Greece from beginning to end. The carved slab of the ancient shepherd of Orchomenus, with his dog and rustic staff, the stélé of the ancient man-at-arms signed \"Aristocles,\" rich originally with colour and gold and fittings of bronze, are among the few still visible pictures, or portraits, it may be, of the earliest Greek life. Compare them, compare their expression, for a moment, with the deeply incised tombstones of the Brethren of St. Francis and their clients, which still roughen the pavement of Santa Croce at Florence, and recall the varnished polychrome decoration of those Greek monuments in connexion with the worn-out blazonry of the funeral brasses of England and Flanders. The Shepherd, the Hoplite, begin a series continuous to the era of full Attic mastery in its gentlest mood, with a large and varied store of memorials of the dead, which, not so strangely as it may [272] seem at first sight, are like selected pages from daily domestic life. See, for instance, at the British Museum, Trypho,-- \"the son of Eutychus,\" one of the very pleasantest human likenesses there, though it came from a cemetery--a son it was hard to leave in it at nineteen or twenty. With all the suppleness, the delicate muscularity, of the flower of his youth, his handsome face sweetened by a kind and simple heart, in motion, surely, he steps forth from some shadowy chamber, strigil in hand, as of old, and with his coarse towel or cloak of monumental drapery over one shoulder. But whither precisely, you may ask, and as what, is he moving there in the doorway? Well! in effect, certainly, it is the memory of the dead lad, emerging thus from his tomb,--the still active soul, or permanent thought, of him, as he most liked to be. The Harpy Tomb, so called from its mysterious winged creatures with human faces, carrying the little shrouded souls of the dead, is a work many generations earlier than that graceful monument of Trypho. It was from an ancient cemetery at Xanthus in Lycia that it came to the British Museum. The Lycians were not a Greek people; but, as happened even with \"barbarians\" dwelling on the coast of Asia Minor, they became lovers of the Hellenic culture, and Xanthus, their capital, as may be judged from the beauty of its ruins, managed to have a considerable portion in Greek art, though infusing it [273] with a certain Asiatic colour. The frugally designed frieze of the Harpy Tomb, in the lowest possible relief, might fairly be placed between the monuments of Assyria and those primitive Greek works among which it now actually stands. The stiffly ranged figures in any other than strictly archaic work would seem affected. But what an undercurrent of refined sentiment, presumably not Asiatic, not \"barbaric,\" lifting those who felt thus about death so early into the main stream of Greek humanity, and to a level of visible refinement in execution duly expressive of it! In that old burial-place of Xanthus, then, a now nameless family, or a single bereaved member of it, represented there as a diminutive figure crouching on the earth in sorrow, erected this monument, so full of family sentiment, and of so much value as illustrating what is for us a somewhat empty period in the history of Greek art, strictly so called. Like the less conspicuously adorned tombs around it, like the tombs in Homer, it had the form of a tower--a square tower about twenty-four feet high, hollowed at the top into a small chamber, for the reception, through a little doorway, of the urned ashes of the dead. Four sculptured slabs were placed at this level on the four sides of the tower in the manner of a frieze. I said that the winged creatures with human faces carry the little souls of the dead. The interpretation of these mystic [274] imageries is, in truth, debated. But in face of them, and remembering how the sculptors and glass-painters of the Middle Age constantly represented the souls of the dead as tiny bodies, one can hardly doubt as to the meaning of these particular details which, repeated on every side, seem to give the key-note of the whole composition.* Those infernal, or celestial, birds, indeed, are not true to what is understood to be the harpy form. Call them sirens, rather. People, and not only old people, as you know, appear sometimes to have been quite charmed away by what dismays most of us. The tiny shrouded figures which the sirens carry are carried very tenderly, and seem to yearn in their turn towards those kindly nurses as they pass on their way to a new world. Their small stature, as I said, does not prove them infants, but only new-born into that other life, and contrasts their helplessness with the powers, the great presences, now around them. A cow, far enough from Myron's famous illusive animal, suckles her calf. She is [275] one of almost any number of artistic symbols of new-birth, of the renewal of life, drawn from a world which is, after all, so full of it. On one side sits enthroned, as some have thought, the Goddess of Death; on the opposite side the Goddess of Life, with her flowers and fruit. Towards her three young maidens are advancing--were they still alive thus, graceful, virginal, with their long, plaited hair, and long, delicately-folded tunics, looking forward to carry on their race into the future? Presented severally, on the other sides of the dark hollow within, three male persons--a young man, an old man, and a boy--seem to be bringing home, somewhat wearily, to their \"long home,\" the young man, his armour, the boy, and the old man, like old Socrates, the mortuary cock, as they approach some shadowy, ancient deity of the tomb, or it may be the throned impersonation of their \"fathers of old.\" The marble surface was coloured, at least in part, with fixtures of metal here and there. The designer, whoever he may have been, was possessed certainly of some tranquillising second thoughts concerning death, which may well have had their value for mourners; and he has expressed those thoughts, if lispingly, yet with no faults of commission, with a befitting grace, and, in truth, at some points, with something already of a really Hellenic definition and vigour. He really speaks to us in his work, through his symbolic and [276] imitative figures,--speaks to our intelligence persuasively. The surviving thought of the lad Trypho, returning from his tomb to the living, was of athletic character; how he was and looked when in the flower of his strength. And it is not of the dead but of the living, who look and are as he, that the artistic genius of this period is full. It is a period, truly, not of battles, such as those commemorated in the Marbles of Aegina, but of more peaceful contests- -at Olympia, at the Isthmus, at Delphi--the glories of which Pindar sang in language suggestive of a sort of metallic beauty, firmly cut and embossed, like crowns of wild olive, of parsley and bay, in crisp gold. First, however, it had been necessary that Greece should win its liberty, political standing-ground, and a really social air to breathe in, with development of the youthful limbs. Of this process Athens was the chief scene; and the earliest notable presentment of humanity by Athenian art was in celebration of those who had vindicated liberty with their lives--two youths again, in a real incident, which had, however, the quality of a poetic invention, turning, as it did, on that ideal or romantic friendship which was characteristic of the Greeks. With something, perhaps, of hieratic convention, yet presented as they really were, as friends and admirers loved to think of them, [277] Harmodius and Aristogeiton stood, then, soon after their heroic death, side by side in bronze, the work of Antenor, in a way not to be forgotten, when, thirty years afterwards, a foreign tyrant, Xerxes, carried them away to Persia. Kritios and Nesistes were, therefore, employed for a reproduction of them, which would naturally be somewhat more advanced in style. In its turn this also disappeared. The more curious student, however, would still fancy he saw the trace of it--of that copy, or of the original, afterwards restored to Athens--here or there, on vase or coin. But in fact the very images of the heroic youths were become but ghosts, haunting the story of Greek art, till they found or seemed to find a body once more when, not many years since, an acute observer detected, as he thought, in a remarkable pair of statues in the Museum of Naples, if freed from incorrect restorations and rightly set together, a veritable descendant from the original work of Antenor. With all their truth to physical form and movement, with a conscious mastery of delineation, they were, nevertheless, in certain details, in the hair, for instance, archaic, or rather archaistic--designedly archaic, as from the hand of a workman, for whom, in this subject, archaism, the very touch of the ancient master, had a sentimental or even a religious value. And unmistakeably they were young assassins, moving, with more than fraternal unity, the younger in advance of and covering [278] the elder, according to the account given by Herodotus, straight to their purpose;--against two wicked brothers, as you remember, two good friends, on behalf of the dishonoured sister of one of them. Archaeologists have loved to adjust them tentatively, with various hypotheses as to the precise manner in which they thus went together. Meantime they have figured plausibly as representative of Attic sculpture at the end of its first period, still immature indeed, but with a just claim to take breath, so to speak, having now accomplished some stades of the journey. Those young heroes of Athenian democracy, then, indicate already what place Athens and Attica will occupy in the supreme age of art soon to come; indicate also the subject from which that age will draw the main stream of its inspiration--living youth, \"iconic\" in its exact portraiture, or \"heroic\" as idealised in various degrees under the influence of great thoughts about it--youth in its self-denying contention towards great effects; great intrinsically, as at Marathon, or when Harmodius and Aristogeiton fell, or magnified by the force and splendour of Greek imagination with the stimulus of the national games. For the most part, indeed, it is not with youth taxed spasmodically, like that of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, and the \"necessity\" that was upon it, that the Athenian mind and heart are now busied; but with youth [279] in its voluntary labours, its habitual and measured discipline, labour for its own sake, or in wholly friendly contest for prizes which in reality borrow all their value from the quality of the receiver. We are with Pindar, you see, in this athletic age of Greek sculpture. It is the period no longer of battle against a foreign foe, recalling the Homeric ideal, nor against the tyrant at home, fixing a dubious ideal for the future, but of peaceful combat as a fine art--pulvis Olympicus. Anticipating the arts, poetry, a generation before Myron and Polycleitus, had drawn already from the youthful combatants in the great national games the motives of those Odes, the bracing words of which, as I said, are like work in fine bronze, or, as Pindar himself suggests, in ivory and gold. Sung in the victor's supper- room, or at the door of his abode, or with the lyre and the pipe as they took him home in procession through the streets, or commemorated the happy day, or in a temple where he laid up his crown, Pindar's songs bear witness to the pride of family or township in the physical perfection of son or citizen, and his consequent success in the long or the short foot-race, or the foot-race in armour, or the pentathlon, or any part of it. \"Now on one, now on another,\" as the poet tells, \"doth the grace that quickeneth (quickeneth, literally, on the race-course) look favourably.\" Ariston hydôr+ he declares indeed, and the actual prize, as we know, was in itself of little or no worth--a [280] cloak, in the Athenian games, but at the greater games a mere handful of parsley, a few sprigs of pine or wild olive. The prize has, so to say, only an intellectual or moral value. Yet actually Pindar's own verse is all of gold and wine and flowers, is itself avowedly a flower, or \"liquid nectar,\" or \"the sweet fruit of his soul to men that are winners in the games.\" \"As when from a wealthy hand one lifting a cup, made glad within with the dew of the vine, maketh gift thereof to a youth\":--the keynote of Pindar's verse is there! This brilliant living youth of his day, of the actual time, for whom, as he says, he \"awakes the clear-toned gale of song\"- -epeôn hoimon ligyn+--that song mingles sometimes with the splendours of a recorded ancient lineage, or with the legendary greatness of a remoter past, its gods and heroes, patrons or ancestors, it might be, of the famous young man of the hour, or with the glory and solemnity of the immortals themselves taking a share in mortal contests. On such pretext he will tell a new story, or bring to its last perfection by his manner of telling it, his pregnancy and studied beauty of expression, an old one. The tale of Castor and Polydeukes, the appropriate patrons of virginal yet virile youth, starred and mounted, he tells in all its human interest. \"Ample is the glory stored up for Olympian winners.\" And what Pindar's contemporaries asked of him for the due appreciation, the [281] consciousness, of it, by way of song, that the next generation sought, by way of sculptural memorial in marble, and above all, as it seems, in bronze. The keen demand for athletic statuary, the honour attached to the artist employed to make his statue at Olympia, or at home, bear witness again to the pride with which a Greek town, the pathos, it might be, with which a family, looked back to the victory of one of its members. In the courts of Olympia a whole population in marble and bronze gathered quickly,--a world of portraits, out of which, as the purged and perfected essence, the ideal soul, of them, emerged the Diadumenus, for instance, the Discobolus, the so-called Jason of the Louvre. Olympia was in truth, as Pindar says again, a mother of gold-crowned contests, the mother of a large offspring. All over Greece the enthusiasm for gymnastic, for the life of the gymnasia, prevailed. It was a gymnastic which, under the happy conditions of that time, was already surely what Plato pleads for, already one half music, mousikê,+ a matter, partly, of character and of the soul, of the fair proportion between soul and body, of the soul with itself. Who can doubt it who sees and considers the still irresistible grace, the contagious pleasantness, of the Discobolus, the Diadumenus, and a few other precious survivals from the athletic age which immediately preceded the manhood of Pheidias, between the Persian and the Peloponnesian wars? [282] Now, this predominance of youth, of the youthful form, in art, of bodily gymnastic promoting natural advantages to the utmost, of the physical perfection developed thereby, is a sign that essential mastery has been achieved by the artist--the power, that is to say, of a full and free realisation. For such youth, in its very essence, is a matter properly within the limits of the visible, the empirical, world; and in the presentment of it there will be no place for symbolic hint, none of that reliance on the helpful imagination of the spectator, the legitimate scope of which is a large one, when art is dealing with religious objects, with what in the fulness of its own nature is not really expressible at all. In any passable representation of the Greek discobolus, as in any passable representation of an English cricketer, there can be no successful evasion of the natural difficulties of the thing to be done--the difficulties of competing with nature itself, or its maker, in that marvellous combination of motion and rest, of inward mechanism with the so smoothly finished surface and outline--finished ad unguem-- which enfold it. Of the gradual development of such mastery of natural detail, a veritable counterfeit of nature, the veritable rhythmus of the runner, for example--twinkling heel and ivory shoulder--we have hints and traces in the historians of art. One had attained the very turn and texture of the [283] crisp locks, another the very feel of the tense nerve and full-flushed vein, while with another you saw the bosom of Ladas expand, the lips part, as if for a last breath ere he reached the goal. It was like a child finding little by little the use of its limbs, the testimony of its senses, at a definite moment. With all its poetic impulse, it is an age clearly of faithful observation, of what we call realism, alike in its iconic and heroic work; alike in portraiture, that is to say, and in the presentment of divine or abstract types. Its workmen are close students now of the living form as such; aim with success at an ever larger and more various expression of its details; or replace a conventional statement of them by a real and lively one. That it was thus is attested indirectly by the fact that they busied themselves, seemingly by way of a tour de force, and with no essential interest in such subject, alien as it was from the pride of health which is characteristic of the gymnastic life, with the expression of physical pain, in Philoctetes, for instance. The adroit, the swift, the strong, in full and free exercise of their gifts, to the delight of others and of themselves, though their sculptural record has for the most part perished, are specified in ancient literary notices as the sculptor's favourite subjects, repeated, remodelled, over and over again, for the adornment of the actual scene of athletic success, or the market-place at home of the distant Northern or Sicilian town [284] whence the prizeman had come.--A countless series of popular illustrations to Pindar's Odes! And if art was still to minister to the religious sense, it could only be by clothing celestial spirits also as nearly as possible in the bodily semblance of the various athletic combatants, whose patrons respectively they were supposed to be. The age to which we are come in the story of Greek art presents to us indeed only a chapter of scattered fragments, of names that are little more, with but surmise of their original significance, and mere reasonings as to the sort of art that may have occupied what are really empty spaces. Two names, however, connect themselves gloriously with certain extant works of art; copies, it is true, at various removes, yet copies of what is still found delightful through them, and by copyists who for the most part were themselves masters. Through the variations of the copyist, the restorer, the mere imitator, these works are reducible to two famous original types--the Discobolus or quoit-player, of Myron, the beau idéal (we may use that term for once justly) of athletic motion; and the Diadumenus of Polycleitus, as, binding the fillet or crown of victory upon his head, he presents the beau idéal of athletic repose, and almost begins to think. Myron was a native of Eleutherae, and a pupil of Ageladas of Argos. There is nothing more to tell by way of positive detail of this so famous [285] artist, save that the main scene of his activity was Athens, now become the centre of the artistic as of all other modes of life in Greece. Multiplicasse veritatem videtur, says Pliny. He was in fact an earnest realist or naturalist, and rose to central perfection in the portraiture, the idealised portraiture, of athletic youth, from a mastery first of all in the delineation of inferior objects, of little lifeless or living things. Think, however, for a moment, how winning such objects are still, as presented on Greek coins;--the ear of corn, for instance, on those of Metapontum; the microscopic cockle-shell, the dolphins, on the coins of Syracuse. Myron, then, passes from pleasant truth of that kind to the delineation of the worthier sorts of animal life,--the ox, the dog-- to nothing short of illusion in the treatment of them, as ancient connoisseurs would have you understand. It is said that there are thirty-six extant epigrams on his brazen cow. That animal has her gentle place in Greek art, from the Siren tomb, suckling her young there, as the type of eternal rejuvenescence, onwards to the procession of the Elgin frieze, where, still breathing deliciously of the distant pastures, she is led to the altar. We feel sorry for her, as we look, so lifelike is the carved marble. The sculptor who worked there, whoever he may have been, had profited doubtless by the study of Myron's famous work. For what purpose he made it, does not appear;--as [286] an architectural ornament; or a votive offering; perhaps only because he liked making it. In hyperbolic epigram, at any rate, the animal breathes, explaining sufficiently the point of Pliny's phrase regarding Myron--Corporum curiosus. And when he came to his main business with the quoit-player, the wrestler, the runner, he did not for a moment forget that they too were animals, young animals, delighting in natural motion, in free course through the yielding air, over uninterrupted space, according to Aristotle's definition of pleasure: \"the unhindered exercise of one's natural force.\" Corporum tenus curiosus:--he was a \"curious workman\" as far as the living body is concerned. Pliny goes on to qualify that phrase by saying that he did not express the sensations of the mind-- animi sensus. But just there, in fact, precisely in such limitation, we find what authenticates Myron's peculiar value in the evolution of Greek art. It is of the essence of the athletic prizeman, involved in the very ideal of the quoit-player, the cricketer, not to give expression to mind, in any antagonism to, or invasion of, the body; to mind as anything more than a function of the body, whose healthful balance of functions it may so easily perturb;--to disavow that insidious enemy of the fairness of the bodily soul as such. Yet if the art of Myron was but little occupied with the reasonable soul (animus), with those mental situations the expression of which, though [287] it may have a pathos and a beauty of its own, is for the most part adverse to the proper expression of youth, to the beauty of youth, by causing it to be no longer youthful, he was certainly a master of the animal or physical soul there (anima); how it is, how it displays itself, as illustrated, for instance, in the Discobolus. Of voluntary animal motion the very soul is undoubtedly there. We have but translations into marble of the original in bronze. In that, it was as if a blast of cool wind had congealed the metal, or the living youth, fixed him imperishably in that moment of rest which lies between two opposed motions, the backward swing of the right arm, the movement forwards on which the left foot is in the very act of starting. The matter of the thing, the stately bronze or marble, thus rests indeed; but the artistic form of it, in truth, scarcely more, even to the eye, than the rolling ball or disk, may be said to rest, at every moment of its course,--just metaphysically, you know. This mystery of combined motion and rest, of rest in motion, had involved, of course, on the part of the sculptor who had mastered its secret, long and intricate consideration. Archaic as it is, primitive still in some respects, full of the primitive youth it celebrates, it is, in fact, a learned work, and suggested to a great analyst of literary style, singular as it may seem, the \"elaborate\" or \"contorted\" manner in literature [288] of the later Latin writers, which, however, he finds \"laudable\" for its purpose. Yet with all its learned involution, thus so oddly characterised by Quintilian, so entirely is this quality subordinated to the proper purpose of the Discobolus as a work of art, a thing to be looked at rather than to think about, that it makes one exclaim still, with the poet of athletes,--The natural is ever best!\"--to de phya hapan kratiston.+ Perhaps that triumphant, unimpeachable naturalness is after all the reason why, on seeing it for the first time, it suggests no new view of the beauty of human form, or point of view for the regarding of it; is acceptable rather as embodying (say, in one perfect flower) all one has ever fancied or seen, in old Greece or on Thames' side, of the unspoiled body of youth, thus delighting itself and others, at that perfect, because unconscious, point of good-fortune, as it moves or rests just there for a moment, between the animal and spiritual worlds. \"Grant them,\" you pray in Pindar's own words, grant them with feet so light to pass through life!\" The face of the young man, as you see him in the British Museum for instance, with fittingly inexpressive expression, (look into, look at the curves of, the blossom-like cavity of the opened mouth) is beautiful, but not altogether virile. The eyes, the facial lines which they gather into one, seem ready to follow the coming motion of the discus as those of an onlooker might be; [289] but that head does not really belong to the discobolus. To be assured of this you have but to compare with that version in the British Museum the most authentic of all derivations from the original, preserved till lately at the Palazzo Massimi in Rome. Here, the vigorous head also, with the face, smooth enough, but spare, and tightly drawn over muscle and bone, is sympathetic with, yields itself to, the concentration, in the most literal sense, of all beside;--is itself, in very truth, the steady centre of the discus, which begins to spin; as the source of will, the source of the motion with which the discus is already on the wing,--that, and the entire form. The Discobolus of the Massimi Palace presents, moreover, in the hair, for instance, those survivals of primitive manner which would mark legitimately Myron's actual pre- Pheidiac standpoint; as they are congruous also with a certain archaic, a more than merely athletic, spareness of form generally-- delightful touches of unreality in this realist of a great time, and of a sort of conventionalism that has an attraction in itself. Was it a portrait? That one can so much as ask the question is a proof how far the master, in spite of his lingering archaism, is come already from the antique marbles of Aegina. Was it the portrait of one much-admired youth, or rather the type, the rectified essence, of many such, at the most pregnant, the essential, moment, of the [290] exercise of their natural powers, of what they really were? Have we here, in short, the sculptor Myron's reasoned memory of many a quoit- player, of a long flight of quoit-players; as, were he here, he might have given us the cricketer, the passing generation of cricketers, sub specie eternitatis, under the eternal form of art? Was it in that case a commemorative or votive statue, such as Pausanias found scattered throughout Greece? Was it, again, designed to be part only of some larger decorative scheme, as some have supposed of the Venus of Melos, or a work of genre as we say, a thing intended merely to interest, to gratify the taste, with no further purpose? In either case it may have represented some legendary quoit-player--Perseus at play with Acrisius fatally, as one has suggested; or Apollo with Hyacinthus, as Ovid describes him in a work of poetic genre. And if the Discobolus is, after all, a work of genre--a work merely imitative of the detail of actual life--for the adornment of a room in a private house, it would be only one of many such produced in Myron's day. It would be, in fact, one of the pristae directly attributed to him by Pliny, little congruous as they may seem with the grandiose motions of his more characteristic work. The pristae, the sawyers,--a celebrated creation of the kind,--is supposed to have given its name to the whole class of like things. No [291] age, indeed, since the rudiments of art were mastered, can have been without such reproductions of the pedestrian incidents of every day, for the mere pleasant exercise at once of the curiosity of the spectator and the imitative instinct of the producer. The Terra- Cotta Rooms of the Louvre and the British Museum are a proof of it. One such work indeed there is, delightful in itself, technically exquisite, most interesting by its history, which properly finds its place beside the larger, the full-grown, physical perfection of the Discobolus, one of whose alert younger brethren he may be,--the Spinario namely, the boy drawing a thorn from his foot, preserved in the so rare, veritable antique bronze at Rome, in the Museum of the Capitol, and well known in a host of ancient and modern reproductions. There, or elsewhere in Rome, tolerated in the general destruction of ancient sculpture--like the \"Wolf of the Capitol,\" allowed by way of heraldic sign, as in modern Siena, or like the equestrian figure of Marcus Aurelius doing duty as Charlemagne,--like those, but like very few other works of the kind, the Spinario remained, well-known and in honour, throughout the Middle Age. Stories like that of Ladas the famous runner, who died as he reached the goal in a glorious foot- race of boys, the subject of a famous work by Myron himself, (the \"last breath,\" as you saw, was on the boy's lips) were told of the half-grown bronze lad at the Capitol. [292] Of necessity, but fatally, he must pause for a few moments in his course; or the course is at length over, or the breathless journey with some all-important tidings; and now, not till now, he thinks of resting to draw from the sole of his foot the cruel thorn, driven into it as he ran. In any case, there he still sits for a moment, for ever, amid the smiling admiration of centuries, in the agility, in the perfect naïveté also as thus occupied, of his sixteenth year, to which the somewhat lengthy or attenuated structure of the limbs is conformable. And then, in this attenuation, in the almost Egyptian proportions, in the shallowness of the chest and shoulders especially, in the Phoenician or old Greek sharpness and length of profile, and the long, conventional, wire-drawn hair of the boy, arching formally over the forehead and round the neck, there is something of archaism, of that archaism which survives, truly, in Myron's own work, blending with the grace and power of well-nigh the maturity of Greek art. The blending of interests, of artistic alliances, is certainly delightful. Polycleitus, the other famous name of this period, and with a fame justified by work we may still study, at least in its immediate derivatives, had also tried his hand with success in such subjects. In the Astragalizontes, for instance, well known to antiquity in countless reproductions, he had treated an incident of the every-day life of every age, which Plato sketches by the way. [293] Myron, by patience of genius, had mastered the secret of the expression of movement, had plucked out the very heart of its mystery. Polycleitus, on the other hand, is above all the master of rest, of the expression of rest after toil, in the victorious and crowned athlete, Diadumenus. In many slightly varying forms, marble versions of the original in bronze of Delos, the Diadumenus, indifferently, mechanically, is binding round his head a ribbon or fillet. In the Vaison copy at the British Museum it was of silver. That simple fillet is, in fact, a diadem, a crown, and he assumes it as a victor; but, as I said, mechanically, and, prize in hand, might be asking himself whether after all it had been worth while. For the active beauty of the Agonistes of which Myron's art is full, we have here, then, the passive beauty of the victor. But the later incident, the realisation of rest, is actually in affinity with a certain earliness, so to call it, in the temper and work of Polycleitus. He is already something of a reactionary; or pauses, rather, to enjoy, to convey enjoyably to others, the full savour of a particular moment in the development of his craft, the moment of the perfecting of restful form, before the mere consciousness of technical mastery in delineation urges forward the art of sculpture to a bewildering infinitude of motion. In opposition to the ease, the freedom, of others, his aim is, by a voluntary restraint in the exercise of such technical mastery, [294] to achieve nothing less than the impeccable, within certain narrow limits. He still hesitates, is self-exacting, seems even to have checked a growing readiness of hand in the artists about him. He was renowned as a graver, found much to do with the chisel, introducing many a fine after-thought, when the rough-casting of his work was over. He studied human form under such conditions as would bring out its natural features, its static laws, in their entirety, their harmony; and in an academic work, so to speak, no longer to be clearly identified in what may be derivations from it, he claimed to have fixed the canon, the common measure, of perfect man. Yet with Polycleitus certainly the measure of man was not yet \"the measure of an angel,\" but still only that of mortal youth; of youth, however, in that scrupulous and uncontaminate purity of form which recommended itself even to the Greeks as befitting messengers from the gods, if such messengers should come. And yet a large part of Myron's contemporary fame depended on his religious work--on his statue of Here, for instance, in ivory and gold--that too, doubtless, expressive, as appropriately to its subject as to himself, of a passive beauty. We see it still, perhaps, in the coins of Argos. And has not the crowned victor, too, in that mechanic action, in his demure attitude, something which reminds us of the religious significance of the Greek athletic service? It was a [295] sort of worship, you know--that department of public life; such worship as Greece, still in its superficial youth, found itself best capable of. At least those solemn contests began and ended with prayer and sacrifice. Their most honoured prizes were a kind of religiously symbolical objects. The athletic life certainly breathes of abstinence, of rule and the keeping under of one's self. And here in the Diadumenus we have one of its priests, a priest of the religion whose central motive was what has been called \"the worship of the body,\"--its modest priest. The so-called Jason at the Louvre, the, Apoxyomenus, and a certain number of others you will meet with from time to time--whatever be the age and derivation of the actual marble which reproduced for Rome, for Africa, or Gaul, types that can have had their first origin in one only time and place--belong, at least aesthetically, to this group, together with the Adorante of Berlin, Winckelmann's antique favourite, who with uplifted face and hands seems to be indeed in prayer, looks immaculate enough to be interceding for others. As to the Jason of the Louvre, one asks at first sight of him, as he stoops to make fast the sandal on his foot, whether the young man can be already so marked a personage. Is he already the approved hero, bent on some great act of his famous epopée; or mere youth only, again, arraying itself mechanically, but alert in eye and soul, prompt to be roused to any [296] great action whatever? The vaguely opened lips certainly suggest the latter view; if indeed the body and the head (in a different sort of marble) really belong to one another. Ah! the more closely you consider the fragments of antiquity, those stray letters of the old Greek aesthetic alphabet, the less positive will your conclusions become, because less conclusive the data regarding artistic origin and purpose. Set here also, however, to the end that in a congruous atmosphere, in a real perspective, they may assume their full moral and aesthetic expression, whatever of like spirit you may come upon in Greek or any other work, remembering that in England also, in Oxford, we have still, for any master of such art that may be given us, subjects truly \"made to his hand.\" As with these, so with their prototypes at Olympia, or at the Isthmus, above all perhaps in the Diadumenus of Polycleitus, a certain melancholy (a pagan melancholy, it may be rightly called, even when we detect it in our English youth) is blent with the final impression we retain of them. They are at play indeed, in the sun; but a little cloud passes over it now and then; and just because of them, because they are there, the whole aspect of the place is chilled suddenly, beyond what one could have thought possible, into what seems, nevertheless, to be the proper and permanent light of day. For though they pass on from age to age the [297] type of what is pleasantest to look on, which, as type, is indeed eternal, it is, of course, but for an hour that it rests with any one of them individually. Assuredly they have no maladies of soul any more than of the body--Animi sensus non expressit. But if they are not yet thinking, there is the capacity of thought, of painful thought, in them, as they seem to be aware wistfully. In the Diadumenus of Polycleitus this expression allies itself to the long-drawn facial type of his preference, to be found also in another very different subject, the ideal of which he fixed in Greek sculpture--the would-be virile Amazon, in exquisite pain, alike of body and soul--the \"Wounded Amazon.\" We may be reminded that in the first mention of athletic contests in Greek literature--in the twenty-third book of the Iliad--they form part of the funeral rites of the hero Patroclus. It is thus, though but in the faintest degree, even with the veritable prince of that world of antique bronze and marble, the Discobolus at Rest of the Vatican, which might well be set where Winckelmann set the Adorante, representing as it probably does, the original of Alcamenes, in whom, a generation after Pheidias, an earlier and more earnest spirit still survived. Although the crisply trimmed head may seem a little too small to our, perhaps not quite rightful, eyes, we might accept him for that canon, or measure, of the perfect human form, which [298] Polycleitus had proposed. He is neither the victor at rest, as with Polycleitus, nor the combatant already in motion, as with Myron; but, as if stepping backward from Myron's precise point ofinterest, and with the heavydiscusstill in the left hand, he is preparing for his venture, taking stand carefully on the right foot. Eye and mind concentre, loyally, entirely, upon the business in hand. The very finger is reckoning while he watches, intent upon the cast of another, as the metal glides to the goal. Take him, to lead you forth quite out of the narrow limits of the Greek world. You have pure humanity there, with a glowing, yet restrained joy and delight in itself, but without vanity; and it is pure. There is nothing certainly supersensual in that fair, round head, any more than in the long, agile limbs; but also no impediment, natural or acquired. To have achieved just that, was the Greek's truest claim for furtherance in the main line of human development. He had been faithful, we cannot help saying, as we pass from that youthful company, in what comparatively is perhaps little--in the culture, the administration, of the visible world; and he merited, so we might go on to say--he merited Revelation, something which should solace his heart in the inevitable fading of that. We are reminded of those strange prophetic words of the Wisdom, the Logos, by whom God made the world, in one of [299] the sapiential, half-Platonic books of the Hebrew Scriptures:--\"I was by him, as one brought up with him; rejoicing in the habitable parts of the earth. My delights were with the sons of men.\"+ NOTES 271. +Transliteration: tymbos amphipolos. Translation: \"a much frequented tomb.\" 274. In some fine reliefs of the thirteenth century, Jesus himself draws near to the deathbed of his Mother. The soul has already quitted her body, and is seated, a tiny crowned figure, on his left arm (as she had carried Him) to be taken to heaven. In the beautiful early fourteenth century monument of Aymer de Valence at Westminster, the soul of the deceased, \"a small figure wrapped in a mantle,\" is supported by two angels at the head of the tomb. Among many similar instances may be mentioned the soul of the beggar, Lazarus, on a carved capital at Vézélay; and the same subject in a coloured window at Bourges.

athletic prizemen a chapter in greek art end preface by charles l shadwell the present volume consists of a collection of essays by the late mr pater all of which have already been given to the public in various magazines and it is owing to the kindness of the several proprietors of those magazines that they can now be brought together in a collected shape it will it is believed be felt that their value is considerably enhanced by their appearance in a single volume where they can throw light upon one another and exhibit by their connexion a more complete view of the scope and purpose of mr pater in dealing with the art and literature of the ancient world the essays fall into two distinct groups one dealing with the subjects of greek mythology and greek poetry the other with the history of greek sculpture and greek architecture but these two groups are not wholly distinct they mutually illustrate one another and serve to enforce mr paters conception of the essential unity in all its manysidedness of the greek character the god understood as the of the things of nature is not only the keynote of the and but reappears as contributing to the interpretation of the growth of greek sculpture thus though in the bibliography of his writings the two groups are separated by a considerable interval there is no change of view he had already reached the centre of the problem and the secret once gained his mode of treatment of the different aspects of greek life and thought is permanent and consistent the essay on was originally prepared as two lectures for delivery in at the birmingham and midland institute these lectures were published in the fortnightly review in jan and feb the appeared in the same review in dec must have been written about the same time as a sequel to the for in mr pater revised the four essays with the intention apparently of publishing them collectively in a volume an intention afterwards abandoned the text now printed has except that of been taken from proofs then set up further corrected in manuscript written long before was not published until when it appeared in macmillans magazine for may it was reprinted without alteration prefixed to dr tyrrells edition of the bacchae first appeared in august in macmillans magazine it was afterwards rewritten but with only a few substantial alterations in mr paters own hand with a view probably of republishing it with other essays this last revise has been followed in the text now printed the papers on greek sculpture are all that remain of a series which if mr pater had lived would probably have grown into a still more important work such a work would have included one or more essays on phidias and the parthenon of which only a fragment though an important fragment can be found amongst his papers and it was to have been prefaced by an introduction to greek studies only a page or two of which was ever written this is not the place to speak of mr paters private virtues the personal charm of his character the brightness of his talk the warmth of his friendship the devotion of his family life but a few words may be permitted on the value of the work by which he will be known to those who never saw him persons only superficially acquainted or by hearsay with his writings are apt to sum up his merits as a writer by saying that he was a master or a consummate master of style but those who have really studied what he wrote do not need to be told that his distinction does not lie in his literary grace alone his fastidious choice of language his power of wordpainting but in the depth and seriousness of his studies that the amount he has produced in a literary life of thirty years is not greater is one proof among many of the spirit in which he worked his genius was that delicacy of insight that gift of penetrating into the heart of things that subtleness of interpretation which with him seems an instinct is the outcome of hard patient conscientious study if he had chosen he might without difficulty have produced a far greater body of work of less value and from a worldly point of view he would have been wise such was not his understanding of the use of his talents cui multum datum est multum quaeretur ab eo those who wish to understand the spirit in which he worked will find it in this volume cls oct notes see p see p see pp was published in the fortnightly review feb and march in the same review in april was published in the contemporary review in february of the present year a study of dionysus the spiritual form of fire and dew writers on mythology speak habitually of the religion of the greeks in thus speaking they are really using a misleading expression and should speak rather of religions each race and class of greeksthe dorians the people of the coast the fishershaving had a religion of its own conceived of the objects that came nearest to it and were most in its thoughts and the resulting usages and ideas never having come to have a precisely harmonised system after the analogy of some other religions the religion of dionysus is the religion of people who pass their lives among the vines as the religion of demeter carries us back to the cornfields and farmsteads of greece and places us in fancy among a primitive race in the furrow and beside the granary so the religion of dionysus carries us back to its vineyards and is a monument of the ways and thoughts of people whose days go by beside the winepress and under the green and purple shadows and whose material happiness depends on the crop of grapes for them the thought of dionysus and his circle a little olympus outside the greater covered the whole of life and was a complete religion a sacred representation or interpretation of the whole human experience modified by the special limitations the special privileges of insight or suggestion incident to their peculiar mode of existence now if the reader wishes to understand what the scope of the religion of dionysus was to the greeks who lived in it all it represented to them by way of one clearly conceived yet complex symbol let him reflect what the loss would be if all the effect and expression drawn from the imagery of the vine and the cup fell out of the whole body of existing poetry how many fascinating trains of reflexion what colour and substance would therewith have been deducted from it filled as it is apart from the more aweful associations of the christian ritual apart from galahads cup with all the various symbolism of the fruit of the vine that supposed loss is but an imperfect measure of all that the name of dionysus recalled to the greek mind under a single imaginable form an outward body of flesh presented to the senses and comprehending as its animating soul a whole world of thoughts surmises greater and less experiences the student of the comparative science of religions finds in the religion of dionysus one of many modes of that primitive treeworship which growing out of some universal instinctive belief that trees and flowers are indeed habitations of living spirits is found almost everywhere in the earlier stages of civilisation enshrined in legend or custom often graceful enough as if the delicate beauty of the object of worship had effectually taken hold on the fancy of the worshipper shelleys sensitive plant shows in what mists of poetical reverie such feeling may still float about a mind full of modern lights the feeling we too have of a life in the green world always ready to assert its claim over our sympathetic fancies who has not at moments felt the scruple which is with us always regarding animal life following the signs of animation further still till one almost hesitates to pluck out the little soul of flower or leaf and in so graceful a faith the greeks had their share what was crude and inane in it becoming in the atmosphere of their energetic imaginative intelligence refined and humanised the oakgrove of dodona the seat of their most venerable oracle did but perpetuate the fancy that the sounds of the wind in the trees may be for certain prepared and chosen ears intelligible voices they could believe in the transmigration of souls into mulberry and laurel mint and hyacinth and the dainty metamorphoses of ovid are but a fossilised form of one morsel here and there from a whole world of transformation with which their nimble fancy was perpetually playing says the homeric hymn to aphrodite of the hamadryads the nymphs which animate the forest trees these then are the nurses of the vine bracing it with interchange of sun and shade they bathe they dance they sing songs of enchantment so that those who seem oddly in love with nature and strange among their fellows are still said to be nympholepti above all they are weavers or spinsters spinning or weaving with airiest fingers and subtlest manycoloured threads the foliage of the trees the petals of flowers the skins of the fruit the long thin stalks on which the poplar leaves are set so lightly that homer compares to them in their constant motion the maids who sit spinning in the house of alcinous the nymphs of naxos where the grapeskin is darkest weave for him a purple robe only the ivy is never transformed is visible as natural ivy to the last pressing the dark outline of its leaves close upon the firm white quite human flesh of the gods forehead in its earliest form then the religion of dionysus presents us with the most graceful phase of this graceful worship occupying a place between the ruder fancies of halfcivilised people concerning life in flower or tree and the dreamy afterfancies of the poet of the sensitive plant he is the soul of the individual vine first the young vine at the housedoor of the newly married for instance as the vinegrower stoops over it coaxing and nursing it like a pet animal or a little child afterwards the soul of the whole species the spirit of fire and dew alive and leaping in a thousand vines as the higher intelligence brooding more deeply over things pursues in thought the generation of sweetness and strength in the veins of the tree the transformation of water into wine little by little noting all the influences upon it of the heaven above and the earth beneath and shadowing forth in each pause of the process an intervening personwhat is to us but the secret chemistry of nature being to them the mediation of living spirits so they passed on to think of dionysus not merely as the soul of the vine but of all that life in flowing things of which the vine is the symbol because its most emphatic example at delos he bears a son from whom in turn spring the three mysterious sisters oeno spermo and elais who dwelling in the island exercise respectively the gifts of turning all things at will into oil and corn and wine in the bacchae of euripides he gives his followers by miracle honey and milk and the water gushes for them from the smitten rock he comes at last to have a scope equal to that of demeter a realm as wide and mysterious as hers the whole productive power of the earth is in him and the explanation of its annual change as some embody their intuitions of that power in corn so others in wine he is the dispenser of the earths hidden wealth giver of riches through the vine as demeter through the grain and as demeter sends the airy daintywheeled and daintywinged spirit of triptolemus to bear her gifts abroad on all winds so dionysus goes on his eastern journey with its many intricate adventures on which he carries his gifts to every people a little olympus outside the greater i said of dionysus and his companions he is the centre of a cycle the hierarchy of the creatures of water and sunlight in many degrees and that fantastic system of treeworship places round him not the fondly whispering spirits of the more graceful inhabitants of woodland only the nymphs of the poplar and the pine but the whole satyr circle intervening between the headship of the vine and the mere earth the grosser less human spirits incorporate and made visible of the more coarse and sluggish sorts of vegetable strength the fig the reed the ineradicable weedthings which will attach themselves climbing about the vinepoles or seeking the sun between the hot stones for as dionysus the spiritual form of the vine is of the highest human type so the figtree and the reed have animal souls mistakeable in the thoughts of a later imperfectly remembering age for mere abstractions of animal nature snubnose and sweetwine and silenus the oldest of them all so old that he has come to have the gift of prophecy quite different from them in origin and intent but confused with them in form are those other companions of dionysus pan and his children homespun dream of simple people and like them in the uneventful tenour of his existence he has almost no story he is but a presence the spiritual form of arcadia and the ways of human life there the reflexion in sacred image or ideal of its flocks and orchards and wild honey the dangers of its hunters its weariness in noonday heat its children agile as the goats they tend who run in their picturesque rags across the solitary wanderers path to startle him in the unfamiliar upper places its one adornment and solace being the dance to the homely shepherds pipe cut by pan first from the sedges of the brook molpeia breathing of remote nature the sense of which is so profound in the homeric hymn to pan the pines the foldings of the hills the leaping streams the strange echoings and dying of sound on the heights things which the religion of dionysus lovespan joins the company of the satyrs amongst them they give their names to insolence and mockery and the finer sorts of malice to unmeaning and ridiculous fear but the best spirits have found in them also a certain human pathos as in displaced beings coming even nearer to most men in their very roughness than the noble and delicate person of the vine dubious creatures halfway between the animal and human kinds speculating wistfully on their being because not wholly understanding themselves and their place in nature as the animals seem always to have this expression to some noticeable degree in the presence of man in the later school of attic sculpture they are treated with more and more of refinement till in some happy moment praxiteles conceived a model often repeated which concentrates this sentiment of true humour concerning them a model of dainty natural ease in posture but with the legs slightly crossed as only lowlybred gods are used to carry them and with some puzzled trouble of youth you might wish for a moment to smoothe away puckering the forehead a little between the pointed ears on which the goodly hair of his animal strength grows low little by little the signs of brute nature are subordinated or disappear and at last robetta a humble italian engraver of the fifteenth century entering into the greek fancy because it belongs to all ages has expressed it in its most exquisite form in a design of ceres and her children of whom their mother is no longer afraid as in the homeric hymn to pan the puck noses have grown delicate so that with platos infatuated lover you may call them winsome if you please and no one would wish those hairy little shanks away with which one of the small pans walks at her side grasping her skirt stoutly while the other the sick or weary one rides in the arms of ceres herself who in graceful italian dress and decked airily with fruit and corn steps across a country of cut sheaves pressing it closely to her with a childs peevish trouble in its face and its small goatlegs and tiny hoofs folded over together precisely after the manner of a little child there is one element in the conception of dionysus which his connexion with the satyrs marsyas being one of them and with pan from whom the flute passed to all the shepherds of theocritus alike illustrates his interest namely in one of the great species of music one form of that wilder vegetation of which the satyr race is the soul made visible is the reed which the creature plucks and trims into musical pipes and as apollo inspires and rules over all the music of strings so dionysus inspires and rules over all the music of the reed the waterplant in which the ideas of water and of vegetable life are brought close together natural property therefore of the spirit of life in the green sap i said that the religion of dionysus was for those who lived in it a complete religion a complete sacred representation and interpretation of the whole of life and as in his relation to the vine he fills for them the place of demeter is the life of the earth through the grape as she through the grain so in this other phase of his being in his relation to the reed he fills for them the place of apollo he is the inherent cause of music and poetry he inspires he explains the phenomena of enthusiasm as distinguished by plato in the phaedrus the secrets of possession by a higher and more energetic spirit than ones own the gift of selfrevelation of passing out of oneself through words tones gestures a winged dionysus venerated at amyclae was perhaps meant to represent him thus as the god of enthusiasm of the rising up on those spiritual wings of which also we hear something in the phaedrus of plato the artists of the renaissance occupied themselves much with the person and the story of dionysus and michelangelo in a work still remaining in florence in which he essayed with success to produce a thing which should pass with the critics for a piece of ancient sculpture has represented him in the fulness as it seems of this enthusiasm an image of delighted entire surrender to transporting dreams and this is no subtle afterthought of a later age but true to certain finer movements of old greek sentiment though it may seem to have waited for the hand of michelangelo before it attained complete realisation the head of ion leans as they recline at the banquet on the shoulder of charmides he mutters in his sleep of things seen therein but awakes as the fluteplayers enter whom charmides has hired for his birthday supper the soul of callias who sits on the other side of charmides flashes out he counterfeits with lifelike gesture the personal tricks of friend or foe or the things he could never utter before he finds words for now the secrets of life are on his lips it is in this loosening of the lips and heart strictly that dionysus is the deliverer eleutherios and of such enthusiasm or ecstasy is in a certain sense an older patron than apollo himself even at delphi the centre of greek inspiration and of the religion of apollo his claim always maintained itself and signs are not wanting that apollo was but a later comer there there under his later reign hard by the golden image of apollo himself near the sacred tripod on which the pythia sat to prophesy was to be seen a strange objecta sort of coffin or cinerary urn with the inscription the pediment of the great temple was divided between themapollo with the nine muses on that side dionysus with perhaps three times three graces on this a third of the whole year was held sacred to him the four winter months were the months of dionysus and in the shrine of apollo itself he was worshipped with almost equal devotion the religion of dionysus takes us back then into that old greek life of the vineyards as we see it on many painted vases with much there as we should find it now as we see it in bennozzo gozzolis mediaeval fresco of the invention of wine in the campo santo at pisa the family of noah presented among all the circumstances of a tuscan vineyard around the press from which the first wine is flowing a painted idyll with its vintage colours still opulent in decay and not without its solemn touch of biblical symbolism for differences we detect in that primitive life and under that greek sky a nimbler play of fancy lightly and unsuspiciously investing all things with personal aspect and incident and a certain mystical apprehension now almost departed of unseen powers beyond the material veil of things corresponding to the exceptional vigour and variety of the greek organisation this peasant life lies in unhistoric time behind the definite forms with which poetry and a refined priesthood afterwards clothed the religion of dionysus and the mere scenery and circumstances of the vineyard have determined many things in its development the noise of the vineyard still sounds in some of his epithets perhaps in his bestknown nameiacchus bacchus the masks suspended on base or cornice so familiar an ornament in later greek architecture are the little faces hanging from the vines and moving in the wind to scare the birds that garland of ivy the aesthetic value of which is so great in the later imagery of dionysus and his descendants the leaves of which floating from his hair become so noble in the hands of titian and tintoret was actually worn on the head for coolness his earliest and most sacred images were wrought in the wood of the vine the people of the vineyard had their feast the little or country dionysia which still lived on side by side with the greater ceremonies of a later time celebrated in december the time of the storing of the new wine it was then that the potters fair came calpis and amphora together with lamps against the winter laid out in order for the choice of buyers for keramus the greek vase is a son of dionysus of wine and of athene who teaches men all serviceable and decorative art then the goat was killed and its blood poured out at the root of the vines and dionysus literally drank the blood of goats and being greeks with quick and mobile sympathies deisidaimones or rather some among them remembering those departed since last year add yet a little more and a little wine and water for the dead also brooding how the sense of these things might pass below the roots to spirits hungry and thirsty perhaps in their shadowy homes but the gaiety that gaiety which aristophanes in the acharnians has depicted with so many vivid touches as a thing of which civil war had deprived the villages of attica preponderates over the grave the travelling country show comes round with its puppets even the slaves have their holiday the mirth becomes excessive they hide their faces under grotesque masks of bark or stain them with winelees or potters crimson even like the old rude idols painted red and carry in midnight procession such rough symbols of the productive force of nature as the women and children had best not look upon which will be frowned upon and refine themselves or disappear in the feasts of cultivated athens of the whole story of dionysus it was the episode of his marriage with ariadne about which ancient art concerned itself oftenest and with most effect here although the antiquarian may still detect circumstances which link the persons and incidents of the legend with the mystical life of the earth as symbols of its annual change yet the merely human interest of the story has prevailed over its earlier significance the spiritual form of fire and dew has become a romantic lover and as a story of romantic love fullest perhaps of all the motives of classic legend of the pride of life it survived with undiminished interest to a later world two of the greatest masters of italian painting having poured their whole power into it titian with greater space of ingathered shore and mountain and solemn foliage and fiery animal life tintoret with profounder luxury of delight in the nearness to each other and imminent embrace of glorious bodily presences and both alike with consummate beauty of physical form hardly less humanised is the theban legend of dionysus the legend of his birth from semele which out of the entire body of tradition concerning him was accepted as central by the athenian imagination for the people of attica he comes from boeotia a country of northern marsh and mist but from whose sombre black marble towns came also the vine the musical reed cut from its sedges and the worship of the graces always so closely connected with the religion of dionysus says sophocles his mother is the daughter of cadmus himself marked out by many curious circumstances as the close kinsman of the earth to which he all but returns at last as the serpent in his old age attesting some closer sense lingering there of the affinity of man with the dust from whence he came semele an old greek word as it seems for the surface of the earth the daughter of cadmus beloved by zeus desires to see her lover in the glory with which he is seen by the immortal hera he appears to her in lightning but the mortal may not behold him and live semele gives premature birth to the child dionysus whom to preserve it from the jealousy of hera zeus hides in a part of his thigh the child returning into the loins of its father whence in due time it is born again yet in this fantastic story hardly less than in the legend of ariadne the story of dionysus has become a story of human persons with human fortunes and even more intimately human appeal to sympathy so that euripides preeminent as a poet of pathos finds in it a subject altogether to his mind all the interest now turns on the development of its points of moral or sentimental significance the love of the immortal for the mortal the presumption of the daughter of man who desires to see the divine form as it is on the fact that not without loss of sight or life itself can man look upon it the travail of nature has been transformed into the pangs of the human mother and the poet dwells much on the pathetic incident of death in childbirth making dionysus as callimachus calls him a seven months child cast out among its enemies motherless and as a consequence of this human interest the legend attaches itself as in an actual history to definite sacred objects and places the venerable relic of the wooden image which fell into the chamber of semele with the lightningflash and which the piety of a later age covered with plates of brass the ivy fountain near thebes the water of which was so wonderfully bright and sweet to drink where the nymphs bathed the newborn child the grave of semele in a sacred enclosure grown with ancient vines where some volcanic heat or flame was perhaps actually traceable near the lightningstruck ruins of her supposed abode yet though the mystical body of the earth is forgotten in the human anguish of the mother of dionysus the sense of his essence of fire and dew still lingers in his most sacred name as the son of semele dithyrambus we speak of a certain wild music in words or rhythm as dithyrambic like the dithyrambus that is the wild choralsinging of the worshippers of dionysus but dithyrambus seems to have been in the first instance the name not of the hymn but of the god to whom the hymn is sung and through a tangle of curious etymological speculations as to the precise derivation of this name one thing seems clearly visible that it commemorates namely the double birth of the vinegod that he is born once and again his birth first of fire and afterwards of dew the two dangers that beset him his victory over two enemies the capricious excessive heats and colds of spring he is pyrigenês then fireborn the son of lightning lightning being to light as regards concentration what wine is to the other strengths of the earth and who that has rested a hand on the glittering silex of a vineyard slope in august where the pale globes of sweetness are lying does not feel this it is out of the bitter salts of a smitten volcanic soil that it comes up with the most curious virtues the mother faints and is parched up by the heat which brings the child to the birth and it pierces through a wonder of freshness drawing its everlasting green and typical coolness out of the midst of the ashes its own stem becoming at last like a tangled mass of tortured metal in thinking of dionysus then as fireborn the greeks apprehend and embody the sentiment the poetry of all tender things which grow out of a hard soil or in any sense blossom before the leaf like the little mezereonplant of english gardens with its palepurple winescented flowers upon the leafless twigs in february or like the almondtrees of tuscany or aarons rod that budded or the staff in the hand of the pope when tannhäusers repentance is accepted and his second birth is of the dew the fire of which he was born would destroy him in his turn as it withered up his mother a second danger comes from this the plant is protected by the influence of the cooling cloud the lower part of his father the sky in which it is wrapped and hidden and of which it is born again its second mother being in some versions of the legend hyéthe dew the nursery where zeus places it to be brought up is a cave in mount nysa sought by a misdirected ingenuity in many lands but really like the place of the carrying away of persephone a place of fantasy the oozy place of springs in the hollow of the hillside nowhere and everywhere where the vine was the nymphs of the trees overshadow it from above the nymphs of the springs sustain it from belowthe hyades those first leaping maenads who as the springs become rainclouds go up to heaven among the stars and descend again as dew or shower upon it so that the religion of dionysus connects itself not with treeworship only but also with ancient waterworship the worship of the spiritual forms of springs and streams to escape from his enemies dionysus leaps into the sea the original of all rain and springs whence in early summer the women of elis and argos were wont to call him with the singing of a hymn and again in thus commemorating dionysus as born of the dew the greeks apprehend and embody the sentiment the poetry of water for not the heat only but its solacethe freshness of the cup this too was felt by those people of the vineyard whom the prophet melampus had taught to mix always their wine with water and with whom the watering of the vines became a religious ceremony the very dead as they thought drinking of and refreshed by the stream and who that has ever felt the heat of a southern country does not know this poetry the motive of the loveliest of all the works attributed to giorgione the fête champêtre in the louvre the intense sensations the subtle and farreaching symbolisms which in these places cling about the touch and sound and sight of it think of the darkness of the well in the breathless court with the delicate ring of ferns kept alive just within the opening of the sound of the fresh water flowing through the wooden pipes into the houses of venice on summer mornings of the cry acqua frésca at padua or verona when the people run to buy what they prize in its rare purity more than wine bringing pleasures so full of exquisite appeal to the imagination that in these streets the very beggars one thinks might exhaust all the philosophy of the epicurean out of all these fancies comes the vinegrowers god the spiritual form of fire and dew beyond the famous representations of dionysus in later art and poetrythe bacchanals of euripides the statuary of the school of praxitelesa multitude of literary allusions and local customs carry us back to this world of vision unchecked by positive knowledge in which the myth is begotten among a primitive people as they wondered over the life of the thing their hands helped forward till it became for them a kind of spirit and their culture of it a kind of worship dionysus as we see him in art and poetry is the projected expression of the ways and dreams of this primitive people brooded over and harmonised by the energetic greek imagination the religious imagination of the greeks being precisely a unifying or identifying power bringing together things naturally asunder making as it were for the human body a soul of waters for the human soul a body of flowers welding into something like the identity of a human personality the whole range of mans experiences of a given object or series of objectsall their outward qualities and the visible facts regarding themall the hidden ordinances by which those facts and qualities hold of unseen forces and have their roots in purely visionary places dionysus came later than the other gods to the centres of greek life and as a consequence of this he is presented to us in an earlier stage of development than they that element of natural fact which is the original essence of all mythology being more unmistakeably impressed upon us here than in other myths not the least interesting point in the study of him is that he illustrates very clearly not only the earlier but also a certain later influence of this element of natural fact in the development of the gods of greece for the physical sense latent in it is the clue not merely to the original signification of the incidents of the divine story but also to the source of the peculiar imaginative expression which its persons subsequently retain in the forms of the higher greek sculpture and this leads me to some general thoughts on the relation of greek sculpture to mythology which may help to explain what the function of the imagination in greek sculpture really was in its handling of divine persons that zeus is in earliest original primitive intention the open sky across which the thunder sometimes sounds and from which the rain descendsis a fact which not only explains the various stories related concerning him but determines also the expression which he retained in the work of pheidias so far as it is possible to recall it long after the growth of those later stories had obscured for the minds of his worshippers his primary signification if men felt as arrian tells us that it was a calamity to die without having seen the zeus of olympia that was because they experienced the impress there of that which the eye and the whole being of man love to find above him and the genius of pheidias had availed to shed upon the gold and ivory of the physical form the blandness the breadth the smile of the open sky the mild heat of it still coming and going in the face of the father of all the children of sunshine and shower as if one of the great white clouds had composed itself into it and looked down upon them thus out of the midsummer noonday so that those things might be felt as warm and fresh and blue by the young and the old the weak and the strong who came to sun themselves in the gods presence as procession and hymn rolled on in the fragrant and tranquil courts of the great olympian temple while all the time those people consciously apprehended in the carved image of zeus none but the personal and really human characteristics or think again of the zeus of dodona the oracle of dodona with its dim grove of oaks and sounding instruments of brass to husband the faintest whisper in the leaves was but a great consecration of that sense of a mysterious will of which people still feel or seem to feel the expression in the motions of the wind as it comes and goes and which makes it indeed seem almost more than a mere symbol of the spirit within us for zeus was indeed the god of the winds also aeolus their socalled god being only his mortal minister as having come by long study of them through signs in the fire and the like to have a certain communicable skill regarding them in relation to practical uses now suppose a greek sculptor to have proposed to himself to present to his worshippers the image of this zeus of dodona who is in the trees and on the currents of the air then if he had been a really imaginative sculptor working as pheidias worked the very soul of those moving sonorous creatures would have passed through his hand into the eyes and hair of the image as they can actually pass into the visible expression of those who have drunk deeply of them as we may notice sometimes in our walks on mountain or shore victory againnikéassociated so often with zeuson the top of his staff on the foot of his throne on the palm of his extended hand meant originally mythologic science tells us only the great victory of the sky the triumph of morning over darkness but that physical morning of her origin has its ministry to the later aesthetic sense also for if niké when she appears in company with the mortal and wholly fleshly hero in whose chariot she stands to guide the horses or whom she crowns with her garland of parsley or bay or whose names she writes on a shield is imaginatively conceived it is because the old skyey influences are still not quite suppressed in her clearset eyes and the dew of the morning still clings to her wings and her floating hair the office of the imagination then in greek sculpture in its handling of divine persons is thus to condense the impressions of natural things into human form to retain that early mystical sense of water or wind or light in the moulding of eye and brow to arrest it or rather perhaps to set it free there as human expression the body of man indeed was for the greeks still the genuine work of prometheus its connexion with earth and air asserted in many a legend not shaded down as with us through innumerable stages of descent but direct and immediate in precise contrast to our physical theory of our life which never seems to fade dream over it as we will out of the light of common day the oracles with their messages to human intelligence from birds and springs of water or vapours of the earth were a witness to that connexion their story went back as they believed with unbroken continuity and in the very places where their later life was lived to a past stretching beyond yet continuous with actual memory in which heaven and earth mingled to those who were sons and daughters of stars and streams and dew to an ancestry of grander men and women actually clothed in or incorporate with the qualities and influences of those objects and we can hardly overestimate the influence on the greek imagination of this mythical connexion with the natural world at not so remote a date and of the solemnising power exercised thereby over their thoughts in this intensely poetical situation the historical greeks the athenians of the age of pericles found themselves it was as if the actual roads on which men daily walk went up and on into a visible wonderland with such habitual impressions concerning the body the physical nature of man the greek sculptor in his later day still free in imagination through the lingering influence of those early dreams may have more easily infused into human form the sense of sun or lightning or cloud to which it was so closely akin the spiritual flesh allying itself happily to mystical meanings and readily expressing seemingly unspeakable qualities but the human form is a limiting influence also and in proportion as art impressed human form in sculpture or in the drama on the vaguer conceptions of the greek mind there was danger of an escape from them of the free spirit of air and light and sky hence all through the history of greek art there is a struggle a streben as the germans say between the palpable and limited human form and the floating essence it is to contain on the one hand was the teeming still fluid world of old beliefs as we see it reflected in the somewhat formless theogony of hesiod a world the titanic vastness of which is congruous with a certain sublimity of speech when he has to speak for instance of motion or space as the greek language itself has a primitive copiousness and energy of words for wind fire water cold soundattesting a deep susceptibility to the impressions of those thingsyet with edges most often melting into each other on the other hand there was that limiting controlling tendency identified with the dorian influence in the history of the greek mind the spirit of a severe and wholly selfconscious intelligence bent on impressing everywhere in the products of the imagination the definite perfectly conceivable human form as the only worthy subject of art less in sympathy with the mystical genealogies of hesiod than with the heroes of homer ending in the entirely humanised religion of apollo the clearly understood humanity of the old greek warriors in the marbles of aegina the representation of man as he is or might be became the aim of sculpture and the achievement of this the subject of its whole history one early carver had opened the eyes another the lips a third had given motion to the feet in various ways in spite of the retention of archaic idols the genuine human expression had come with the truthfulness of life itself these two tendencies then met and struggled and were harmonised in the supreme imagination of pheidias in sculptureof aeschylus in the drama hence a series of wondrous personalities of which the greek imagination became the dwellingplace beautiful perfectly understood human outlines embodying a strange delightful lingering sense of clouds and water and sun such a world the world of really imaginative greek sculpture we still see reflected in many a humble vase or battered coin in bacchante and centaur and amazon evolved out of that with most command in the consummate fragments of the parthenon not indeed so that he who runs may read the gifts of greek sculpture being always delicate and asking much of the receiver but yet visible and a pledge to us of creative power as to the worshipper of the presence which without that material pledge had but vaguely haunted the fields and groves this then was what the greek imagination did for mens sense and experience of natural forces in athene in zeus in poseidon for mens sense and experience of their own bodily qualitiesswiftness energy power of concentrating sight and hand and foot on a momentary physical actin the close hair the chastened muscle the perfectly poised attention of the quoitplayer for mens sense again of ethical qualitiesrestless idealism inward vision power of presence through that vision in scenes behind the experience of ordinary menin the idealised alexander to illustrate this function of the imagination as especially developed in greek art we may reflect on what happens with us in the use of certain names as expressing summarily this name for you and that for mehelen gretchen marya hundred associations trains of sound forms impressions remembered in all sorts of degrees which through a very wide and full experience they have the power of bringing with them in which respect such names are but revealing instances of the whole significance power and use of language in general wellthe mythical conception projected at last in drama or sculpture is the name the instrument of the identification of the given matterof its unity in variety its outline or definition in mystery its spiritual form to use again the expression i have borrowed from william blakeform with hands and lips and opened eyelidsspiritual as conveying to us in that the soul of rain or of a greek river or of swiftness or purity to illustrate this think what the effect would be if you could associate by some trick of memory a certain group of natural objects in all their varied perspective their changes of colour and tone in varying light and shade with the being and image of an actual person you travelled through a country of clear rivers and wide meadows or of high windy places or of lowly grass and willows or of the lady of the lake and all the complex impressions of these objects wound themselves as a second animated body new and more subtle around the person of some one left there so that they no longer come to recollection apart from each other now try to conceive the image of an actual person in whom somehow all those impressions of the vine and its fruit as the highest type of the life of the green sap had become incorporateall the scents and colours of its flower and fruit and something of its curling foliage the chances of its growth the enthusiasm the easy flow of more choice expression as its juices mount within one for the image is eloquent too in word gesture and glancing of the eyes which seem to be informed by some soul of the vine within it as wordsworth says beauty born of murmuring sound shall pass into her face so conceive an image into which the beauty of the vine has passed and you have the idea of dionysus as he appears entirely fashioned at last by central greek poetry and art and is consecrated in the oinophoria and the anthestêria the great festivals of the winepress and the flowers the word wine and with it the germ of the myth of dionysus is older than the separation of the indogermanic race yet with the people of athens dionysus counted as the youngest of the gods he was also the son of a mortal dead in childbirth and seems always to have exercised the charm of the latest born in a sort of allowable fondness through the finespun speculations of modern ethnologists and grammarians noting the changes in the letters of his name and catching at the slightest historical records of his worship we may trace his coming from phrygia the birthplace of the more mystical elements of greek religion over the mountains of thrace on the heights of pangaeus he leaves an oracle with a perpetually burning fire famous down to the time of augustus who reverently visited it southwards still over the hills of parnassus which remained for the inspired women of boeotia the centre of his presence he comes to thebes and the family of cadmus from boeotia he passes to attica to the villages first at last to athens at an assignable date under peisistratus out of the country into the town to this stage of his townlife that dionysus of already belonged it was to the athenians of the town to urbane young men sitting together at the banquet that those expressions of a sudden eloquence came of the loosened utterance and finer speech its colour and imagery dionysus then has entered athens to become urbane like them to walk along the marble streets in frequent procession in the persons of noble youths like those who at the oschophoria bore the branches of the vine from his temple to the temple of athene of the parasol or of beautiful slaves to contribute through the arts to the adornment of life yet perhaps also in part to weaken it relaxing ancient austerity gradually his rough country feasts will be outdone by the feasts of the town and as comedy arose out of those so these will give rise to tragedy for his entrance upon this new stage of his career his coming into the town is from the first tinged with melancholy as if in entering the town he had put off his country peace the other olympians are above sorrow dionysus like a strenuous mortal hero like hercules or perseus has his alternations of joy and sorrow of struggle and hardwon triumph it is out of the sorrows of dionysus thenof dionysus in winterthat all greek tragedy grows out of the song of the sorrows of dionysus sung at his winter feast by the chorus of satyrs singers clad in goatskins in memory of his rural life one and another of whom from time to time steps out of the company to emphasise and develope this or that circumstance of the story and so the song becomes dramatic he will soon forget that early country life or remember it but as the dreamy background of his later existence he will become as always in later art and poetry of dazzling whiteness no longer dark with the air and sun but like one eskiatrofêkôsbrought up under the shade of eastern porticoes or pavilions or in the light that has only reached him softened through the texture of green leaves honeypale like the delicate people of the city like the flesh of women as those old vasepainters conceive of it who leave their hands and faces untouched with the pencil on the white clay the ruddy god of the vineyard stained with winelees or coarser colour will hardly recognise his double in the white graceful mournful figure weeping chastened lifting up his arms in yearning affection towards his latefound mother as we see him on a famous etruscan mirror only in thinking of this early tragedy of these town feasts and of the entrance of dionysus into athens you must suppose not the later athens which is oftenest in our thoughts the athens of pericles and pheidias but that little earlier athens of peisistratus which the persians destroyed which some of us perhaps would rather have seen in its early simplicity than the greater one when the old image of the god carved probably out of the stock of an enormous vine had just come from the village of eleutherae to his first temple in the lenaeumthe quarter of the winepresses near the limnaethe marshy place which in athens represents the cave of nysa its little buildings on the hilltop still with steep rocky ways crowding round the ancient temple of erechtheus and the grave of cecrops with the old miraculous olivetree still growing there and the old snake of athene polias still alive somewhere in the temple court the artists of the italian renaissance have treated dionysus many times and with great effect but always in his joy as an embodiment of that glory of nature to which the renaissance was a return but in an early engraving of mocetto there is for once a dionysus treated differently the cold light of the background displays a barren hill the bridge and towers of an italian town and quiet water in the foreground at the root of a vine dionysus is sitting in a posture of statuesque weariness the leaves of the vine are grandly drawn and wreathing heavily round the head of the god suggest the notion of his incorporation into it the right hand holding a great vessel languidly and indifferently lets the stream of wine flow along the earth while the left supports the forehead shadowing heavily a face comely but full of an expression of painful brooding one knows not how far one may really be from the mind of the old italian engraver in gathering from his design this impression of a melancholy and sorrowing dionysus but modern motives are clearer and in a bacchus by a young hebrew painter in the exhibition of the royal academy of there was a complete and very fascinating realisation of such a motive the god of the bitterness of wine the seawater of the lesbian grape become somewhat brackish in the cup touched by the sentiment of this subtler melancholy dionysus we may ask whether anything similar in feeling is to be actually found in the range of greek ideashad some antitype of this fascinating figure any place in greek religion yes in a certain darker side of the double god of nature obscured behind the brighter episodes of thebes and naxos but never quite forgotten something corresponding to this deeper more refined idea really existedthe conception of dionysus zagreus an image which has left indeed but little effect in greek art and poetry which criticism has to put patiently together out of late scattered hints in various writers but which is yet discernible clearly enough to show that it really visited certain greek minds here and there and discernible not as a late after thought but as a tradition really primitive and harmonious with the original motive of the idea of dionysus in its potential though unrealised scope it is perhaps the subtlest dream in greek religious poetry and is at least part of the complete physiognomy of dionysus as it actually reveals itself to the modern student after a complete survey the whole compass of the idea of dionysus a dual god of both summer and winter became ultimately as we saw almost identical with that of demeter the phrygians believed that the god slept in winter and awoke in summer and celebrated his waking and sleeping or that he was bound and imprisoned in winter and unbound in spring we saw how in elis and at argos the women called him out of the sea with the singing of hymns in early spring and a beautiful ceremony in the temple at delphi which as we know he shares with apollo described by plutarch represents his mystical resurrection yearly about the time of the shortest day just as the light begins to increase and while hope is still tremulously strung the priestesses of dionysus were wont to assemble with many lights at his shrine and there with songs and dances awoke the newborn child after his wintry sleep waving in a sacred cradle like the great basket used for winnowing corn a symbolical image or perhaps a real infant he is twofold thena döppelganger like persephone he belongs to two worlds and has much in common with her and a full share of those dark possibilities which even apart from the story of the rape belong to her he is a chthonian god and like all the children of the earth has an element of sadness like hades himself he is hollow and devouring an eater of mans fleshsarcophagusthe grave which consumed unaware the ivorywhite shoulder of pelops and you have no sooner caught a glimpse of this image than a certain perceptible shadow comes creeping over the whole story for in effect we have seen glimpses of the sorrowing dionysus all along part of the interest of the theban legend of his birth is that he comes of the marriage of a god with a mortal woman and from the first like merely mortal heroes he falls within the sphere of human chances at first indeed the melancholy settles round the person of his mother dead in childbirth and ignorant of the glory of her son in shame according to euripides punished as her own sisters allege for impiety the death of semele is a sort of ideal or type of this peculiar claim on human pity as the descent of persephone into hades of all human pity over the early death of women accordingly his triumph being now consummated he descends into hades through the unfathomable alcyonian lake according to the most central version of the legend to bring her up from thence and that hermes the shadowy conductor of souls is constantly associated with dionysus in the story of his early life is not without significance in this connexion as in delphi the winter months were sacred to him so in athens his feasts all fall within the four months on this and the other side of the shortest day as persephone spends those four monthsa third part of the yearin hades son or brother of persephone he actually becomes at last in confused half developed tradition and even has his place with his dark sister in the eleusinian mysteries as iacchus where on the sixth day of the feast in the great procession from athens to eleusis we may still realise his image moving up and down above the heads of the vast multitude as he goes beside to the temple of demeter amid the light of torches at noonday but it was among the mountains of thrace that this gloomier element in the being of dionysus had taken the strongest hold as in the sunny villages of attica the cheerful elements of his religion had been developed so in those wilder northern regions people continued to brood over its darker side and hence a current of gloomy legend descended into greece the subject of the bacchanals of euripides is the infatuated opposition of pentheus king of thebes to dionysus and his religion his cruelty to the god whom he shuts up in prison and who appears on the stage with his delicate limbs cruelly bound but who is finally triumphant pentheus the man of grief being torn to pieces by his own mother in the judicial madness sent upon her by the god in this play euripides has only taken one of many versions of the same story in all of which dionysus is victorious his enemy being torn to pieces by the sacred women or by wild horses or dogs or the fangs of cold or the maenad ambrosia whom he is supposed to pursue for purposes of lust suddenly becomes a vine and binds him down to the earth inextricably in her serpentine coils in all these instances then dionysus punishes his enemies by repaying them in kind but a deeper vein of poetry pauses at the sorrow and in the conflict does not too soon anticipate the final triumph it is dionysus himself who exhausts these sufferings hence in many formsreflexes of all the various phases of his wintry existencethe image of dionysus zagreus the hunterof dionysus in winterstorming wildly on the dark thracian hills from which like ares and boreas he originally descends into greece the thought of the hunter concentrating into itself all mens forebodings over the departure of the year at its richest and the death of all sweet things in the longcontinued cold when the sick and the old and little children gazing out morning after morning on the dun sky can hardly believe in the return any more of a bright day or he is connected with the fears the dangers and hardships of the hunter himself lost or slain sometimes far from home in the dense woods of the mountains as he seeks his meat so ardently becoming in his chase almost akin to the wild beaststo the wolf who comes before us in the name of lycurgus one of his bitterest enemiesand a phase therefore of his own personality in the true intention of the myth this transformation this image of the beautiful soft creature become an enemy of human kind putting off himself in his madness wronged by his own fierce hunger and thirst and haunting with terrible sounds the high thracian farms is the most tragic note of the whole picture and links him on to one of the gloomiest creations of later romance the werewolf the belief in which still lingers in greece as in france where it seems to become incorporate in the darkest of all romantic histories that of gilles de retz and now we see why the tradition of human sacrifice lingered on in greece in connexion with dionysus as a thing of actual detail and not remote so that dionysius of halicarnassus counts it among the horrors of greek religion that the sacred women of dionysus ate in mystical ceremony raw flesh and drank blood is a fact often mentioned and commemorates as it seems the actual sacrifice of a fair boy deliberately torn to pieces fading at last into a symbolical offering at delphi the wolf was preserved for him on the principle by which venus loves the dove and hera peacocks and there were places in which after the sacrifice of a kid to him a curious mimic pursuit of the priest who had offered it represented the still surviving horror of one who had thrown a child to the wolves the three daughters of minyas devote themselves to his worship they cast lots and one of them offers her own tender infant to be torn by the three like a roe then the other women pursue them and they are turned into bats or moths or other creatures of the night and fable is endorsed by history plutarch telling us how before the battle of salamis with the assent of themistocles three persian captive youths were offered to dionysus the devourer as then some embodied their fears of winter in persephone others embodied them in dionysus a devouring god whose sinister side is illustrated in the dark and shameful secret society described by livy in which his worship ended at rome afterwards abolished by solemn act of the senate he becomes a new aidoneus a hunter of mens souls like him to be appeased only by costly sacrifices and then dionysus recovering from his midwinter madness how intensely these people conceive the spring it is that triumphant dionysus cured of his great malady and sane in the clear light of the longer days whom euripides in the bacchanals sets before us as still essentially the hunter zagreus though he keeps the red streams and torn flesh away from the delicate body of the god in his long vesture of white and gold and fragrant with eastern odours of this i hope to speak in another paper let me conclude this by one phase more of religious custom if dionysus like persephone has his gloomy side like her he has also a peculiar message for a certain number of refined minds seeking in the later days of greek religion such modifications of the old legend as may minister to ethical culture to the perfecting of the moral nature a type of second birth from first to last he opens in his series of annual changes for minds on the lookout for it the hope of a possible analogy between the resurrection of nature and something else as yet unrealised reserved for human souls and the beautiful weeping creature vexed by the wind suffering torn to pieces and rejuvenescent again at last like a tender shoot of living green out of the hardness and stony darkness of the earth becomes an emblem or ideal of chastening and purification and of final victory through suffering it is the finer mystical sentiment of the few detached from the coarser and more material religion of the many and accompanying it through the course of its history as its ethereal less palpable lifegiving soul and as always happens seeking the quiet and not too anxious to make itself felt by others with some unfixed though real place in the general scheme of greek religion this phase of the worship of dionysus had its special development in the orphic literature and mysteries obscure as are those followers of the mystical orpheus we yet certainly see them moving and playing their part in the later ages of greek religion old friends with new faces though they had as plato witnesses their less worthy aspect in certain appeals to vulgar superstitious fears they seem to have been not without the charm of a real and inward religious beauty with their neologies their new readings of old legends their sense of mystical second meanings as they refined upon themes grown too familiar and linked in a sophisticated age the new to the old in this respect we may perhaps liken them to the mendicant orders in the middle ages with their florid romantic theology beyond the bounds of orthodox tradition giving so much new matter to art and poetry they are a picturesque addition also to the exterior of greek life with their white dresses their dirges their fastings and ecstasies their outward asceticism and material purifications and the central object of their worship comes before us as a tortured persecuted slain godthe suffering dionysusof whose legend they have their own special and esoteric version that version embodied in a supposed orphic poem the occultation of dionysus is represented only by the details that have passed from it into the almost endless dionysiaca of nonnus a writer of the fourth century and the imagery has to be put back into the shrine bit by bit and finally incomplete its central point is the picture of the rending to pieces of a divine child of whom a tradition scanty indeed but harmonious in its variations had long maintained itself it was in memory of it that those who were initiated into the orphic mysteries tasted of the raw flesh of the sacrifice and thereafter ate flesh no more and it connected itself with that strange object in the delphic shrine the grave of dionysus son first of zeus and of persephone whom zeus woos in the form of a serpentthe white goldenhaired child the bestbeloved of his father and destined by him to be the ruler of the world grows up in secret but one day zeus departing on a journey in his great fondness for the child delivered to him his crown and staff and so left himshut in a strong tower then it came to pass that the jealous here sent out the titans against him they approached the crowned child and with many sorts of playthings enticed him away to have him in their power and then miserably slew him hacking his body to pieces as the wind tears the vine with the axe pelekus which like the swords of roland and arthur has its proper name the fragments of the body they boiled in a great cauldron and made an impious banquet upon them afterwards carrying the bones to apollo whose rival the young child should have been thinking to do him service but apollo in great pity for this his youngest brother laid the bones in a grave within his own holy place meanwhile here full of her vengeance brings to zeus the heart of the child which she had snatched still beating from the hands of the titans but zeus delivered the heart to semele and the soul of the child remaining awhile in

liddell and scott definition participle of skiatropheo the bacchanals of euripides so far i have endeavoured to present with something of the concrete character of a picture dionysus the old greek god as we may discern him through a multitude of stray hints in art and poetry and religious custom through modern speculation on the tendencies of early thought through traits and touches in our own actual states of mind which may seem sympathetic with those tendencies in such a picture there must necessarily be a certain artificiality things near and far matter of varying degrees of certainty fact and surmise being reflected and concentrated for its production as if on the surface of a mirror such concrete character however greek poet or sculptor from time to time impressed on the vague world of popular belief and usage around him and in the bacchanals of euripides we have an example of the figurative or imaginative power of poetry selecting and combining at will from that mixed and floating mass weaving the manycoloured threads together blending the various phases of legendall the light and shade of the subjectinto a shape substantial and firmly set through which a mere fluctuating tradition might retain a permanent place in mens imaginations here in what euripides really says in what we actually see on the stage as we read his play we are dealing with a single real object not with uncertain effects of many halffancied objects let me leave you for a time almost wholly in his hands while you look very closely at his work so as to discriminate its outlines clearly this tragedy of the bacchanalsa sort of masque or morality as we saya monument as central for the legend of dionysus as the homeric hymn for that of demeter is unique in greek literature and has also a singular interest in the life of euripides himself he is writing in old age not at athens nor for a polished attic audience but for a wilder and less temperately cultivated sort of people at the court of archelaus in macedonia writing in old age he is in that subdued mood a mood not necessarily sordid in which accustomed ideas conformable to a sort of common sense regarding the unseen oftentimes regain what they may have lost in a mans allegiance it is a sort of madness he begins to think to differ from the received opinions thereon not that he is insincere or ironical but that he tends in the sum of probabilities to dwell on their more peaceful side to sit quiet for the short remaining time in the reflexion of the more cheerfully lighted side of things and what is accustomedwhat holds of familiar usage comes to seem the whole essence of wisdom on all subjects and the wellknown delineation of the vague country in homer or hesiod ones best attainable mental outfit for the journey thither with this sort of quiet wisdom the whole play is penetrated euripides has said or seemed to say many things concerning greek religion at variance with received opinion and now in the end of life he desires to make his peacewhat shall at any rate be peace with men he is in the mood for acquiescence or even for a palinode and this takes the direction partly of mere submission to partly of a refining upon the authorised religious tradition he calmly sophisticates this or that element of it which had seemed grotesque and has like any modern writer a theory how myths were made and how in lapse of time their first signification gets to be obscured among mortals and what he submits to that he will also adorn fondly by his genius for words and that very neighbourhood afforded him his opportunity it was in the neighbourhood of pella the macedonian capital that the worship of dionysus the newest of the gods prevailed in its most extravagant formthe thiasus or wild nocturnal procession of bacchic women retired to the woods and hills for that purpose with its accompaniments of music and lights and dancing rational and moderate athenians as we may gather from some admissions of euripides himself somewhat despised all that while those who were more fanatical forsook the home celebrations and went on pilgrimage from attica to cithaeron or delphi but at pella persons of high birth took part in the exercise and at a later period we read in plutarch how olympias the mother of alexander the great was devoted to this enthusiastic worship although in one of botticellis pictures the angels dance very sweetly and may represent many circumstances actually recorded in the hebrew scriptures yet we hardly understand the dance as a religious ceremony the bare mention of it sets us thinking on some fundamental differences between the pagan religions and our own it is to such ecstasies however that all natureworship seems to tend that giddy intoxicating sense of springthat tingling in the veins sympathetic with the yearning life of the earth having apparently in all times and places prompted some mode of wild dancing coleridge in one of his fantastic speculations refining on the german word for enthusiasm schwärmerei swarming as he says has explained how the sympathies of mere numbers as such the random catching on fire of one here and another there when people are collected together generates as if by mere contact some new and rapturous spirit not traceable in the individual units of a multitude such swarming was the essence of that strange dance of the bacchic women literally like winged things they follow with motives we may suppose never quite made clear even to themselves their new strange romantic god himself a womanlike godit was on women and feminine souls that his power mainly fell at elis it was the women who had their own little song with which at springtime they professed to call him from the sea at brasiae they had their own temple where none but women might enter and so the thiasus also is almost exclusively formed of womenof those who experience most directly the influence of things which touch thought through the sensesthe presence of night the expectation of morning the nearness of wild unsophisticated natural thingsthe echoes the coolness the noise of frightened creatures as they climbed through the darkness the sunrise seen from the hilltops the disillusion the bitterness of satiety the deep slumber which comes with the morning athenians visiting the macedonian capital would hear and from time to time actually see something of a religious custom in which the habit of an earlier world might seem to survive as they saw the lights flitting over the mountains and heard the wild sharp cries of the women there was presented as a singular fact in the more prosaic actual life of a later time an enthusiasm otherwise relegated to the wonderland of a distant past in which a supposed primitive harmony and understanding between man and nature renewed itself later sisters of centaur and amazon the maenads as they beat the earth in strange sympathy with its waking up from sleep or as in the description of the messenger in the play of euripides they lie sleeping in the glen revealed among the morning mists were themselves indeed as remnantsflecks left here and there and not yet quite evaporated under the hard light of a later and commoner dayof a certain cloudworld which had once covered all things with a veil of mystery whether or not in what was often probably coarse as well as extravagant there may have lurked some finer vein of ethical symbolism such as euripides hints atthe soberer influence in the thiasus of keen air and animal expansion certainly for art and a poetry delighting in colour and form it was a custom rich in suggestion the imitative arts would draw from it altogether new motives of freedom and energy of freshness in old forms it is from this fantastic scene that the beautiful windtouched draperies the rhythm the heads suddenly thrown back of many a pompeian wall painting and sarcophagusfrieze are originally derived and that melting languor that perfectly composed lassitude of the fallen maenad became a fixed type in the school of grace the school of praxiteles the circumstances of the place thus combining with his peculiar motive euripides writes the bacchanals it is this extravagant phase of religion and the latestborn of the gods which as an amende honorable to the once slighted traditions of greek belief he undertakes to interpret to an audience composed of people who like scyles the hellenising king of scythia feel the attraction of greek religion and greek usage but on their quainter side and partly relish that extravagance subject and audience alike stimulate the romantic temper and the tragedy of the bacchanals with its innovations in metre and diction expressly noted as foreign or barbarousall the charm and grace of the clearpitched singing of the chorus notwithstandingwith its subtleties and sophistications its grotesques mingled with and heightening a real shudder at the horror of the theme and a peculiarly fine and human pathos is almost wholly without the reassuring calm generally characteristic of the endings of greek tragedy is itself excited troubled disturbinga spotted or dappled thing like the oddly dappled fawn skins of its own masquerade so aptly expressive of the shifty twofold rapidlydoubling genius of the divine wild creature himself let us listen and watch the strange masks coming and going for a while as far as may be as we should do with a modern play what are its charms what is still alive impressive and really poetical for us in the dim old greek play the scene is laid at thebes where the memory of semele the mother of dionysus is still under a cloud her own sisters sinning against natural affection pitiless over her pathetic death and finding in it only a judgment upon the impiety with which having shamed herself with some mortal lover she had thrown the blame of her sin upon zeus have so far triumphed over her the true and glorious version of her story lives only in the subdued memory of the two aged men teiresias the prophet and her father cadmus apt now to let things go loosely by who has delegated his royal power to pentheus the son of one of those sistersa hotheaded and impious youth so things had passed at thebes and now a strange circumstance has happened an odd sickness has fallen upon the women dionysus has sent the sting of his enthusiasm upon them and has pushed it to a sort of madness a madness which imitates the true thiasus forced to have the form without the profit of his worship the whole female population leaving distaff and spindle and headed by the three princesses have deserted the town and are lying encamped on the bare rocks or under the pines among the solitudes of cithaeron and it is just at this point that the divine child supposed to have perished at his mothers side in the flames returns to his birthplace grown to manhood dionysus himself speaks the prologue he is on a journey through the world to found a new religion and the first motive of this new religion is the vindication of the memory of his mother in explaining this design euripides who seeks always for pathetic effect tells in few words touching because simple the story of semelehere and again still more intensely in the chorus which followsthe merely human sentiment of maternity being not forgotten even amid the thought of the divine embraces of her fiery bedfellow it is out of tenderness for her that the sons divinity is to be revealed a yearning affection the affection with which we see him lifting up his arms about her satisfied at last on an old etruscan metal mirror has led him from place to place everywhere he has had his dances and established his worship and everywhere his presence has been her justification first of all the towns in greece he comes to thebes the scene of her sorrows he is standing beside the sacred waters of dirce and ismenus the holy place is in sight he hears the greek speech and sees at last the ruins of the place of her lyingin at once his own birthchamber and his mothers tomb his image as it detaches itself little by little from the episodes of the play and is further characterised by the songs of the chorus has a singular completeness of symbolical effect the incidents of a fully developed human personality are superinduced on the mystical and abstract essence of that fiery spirit in the flowing veins of the earththe aroma of the green world is retained in the fair human body set forth in all sorts of finer ethical lights and shadeswith a wonderful kind of subtlety in the course of his long progress from land to land the gold the flowers the incense of the east have attached themselves deeply to him their effect and expression rest now upon his flesh like the gleaming of that old ambrosial ointment of which homer speaks as resting ever on the persons of the gods and cling to his clothingthe mitre binding his perfumed yellow hairthe long tunic down to the white feet somewhat womanly and the fawnskin with its rich spots wrapped about the shoulders as the door opens to admit him the scented air of the vineyards blows through while the convolvulus on his mystic rod represents all wreathing flowery things whatever with or without fruit as in america all such plants are still called vines the excitement of which he loves so deeply and to which he constantly invites his followers and profoundly amorous his presence embodies all the voluptuous abundance of asia its beating sun its which the chorus describe in their luscious vocabulary with the rich eastern nameslydia persia arabia felix he is a sorcerer or an enchanter the tyrant pentheus thinks the springs of water the flowing of honey and milk and wine are his miracles wrought in person we shall see presently how writing for that northern audience euripides crosses the theban with the gloomier thracian legend and lets the darker stain show through yet from the first amid all this floweriness a touch or trace of that gloom is discernible the fawnskin composed now so daintily over the shoulders may be worn with the whole coat of the animal made up the hoofs gilded and tied together over the right shoulder to leave the right arm disengaged to strike its head clothing the human head within as alexander on some of his coins looks out from the elephants scalp and hercules out of the jaws of a lion on the coins of camarina those diminutive golden horns attached to the forehead represent not fecundity merely nor merely the crisp tossing of the waves of streams but horns of offence and our fingers must beware of the thyrsus tossed about so wantonly by himself and his chorus the pinecone at its top does but cover a spearpoint and the thing is a weaponthe sharp spear of the hunter zagreusthough hidden now by the fresh leaves and that button of pinecone which he has plucked down coming through the forest at peace for a while this spring morning and the chorus emphasise this character their songs weaving for the whole piece in words more effective than any painted scenery a certain congruous background which heightens all the intimate sense of mountains and mountain things being in this way maintained throughout and concentrated on the central figure they say and we may think we see the green festoons of the vine dropping quickly from footplace to footplace down the broken hillside in spring when like the bacchanals all who can wander out of the town to enjoy the earliest heats we say a strange madness seems to lurk among the flowers ready to lay hold on us also autika ga pasa choreuseisoon the whole earth will dance and sing dionysus is especially a womans deity and he comes from the east conducted by a chorus of gracious lydian women his true sisters bassarids clad like himself in the long tunic or bassara they move and speak to the music of clangorous metallic instruments cymbals and tambourines relieved by the clearer notes of the pipe and there is a strange variety of almost imitative sounds for such music in their very words the homeric hymn to demeter precedes the art of sculpture but is rich in suggestions for it here on the contrary in the first chorus of the bacchanals as elsewhere in the play we feel that the poetry of euripides is probably borrowing something from art that in these choruses with their repetitions and refrains he is reproducing perhaps the spirit of some sculptured relief which like luca della robbias celebrated work for the organloft of the cathedral of florence worked by various subtleties of line not in the lips and eyes only but in the drapery and hands also to a strange reality of impression of musical effect on visible things they beat their drums before the palace and then a humourous little scene a reflex of the old dionysiac comedyof that laughter which was an essential element of the earliest worship of dionysusfollows the first chorus the old blind prophet teiresias and the aged king cadmus always secretly true to him have agreed to celebrate the thiasus and accept his divinity openly the youthful god has nowhere said decisively that he will have none but young men in his sacred dance but for that purpose they must put on the long tunic and that spotted skin which only rustics wear and assume the thyrsus and ivycrown teiresias arrives and is seen knocking at the doors and then just as in the medieval mystery comes the inevitable grotesque not unwelcome to our poet who is wont in his plays perhaps not altogether consciously to intensify by its relief both the pity and the terror of his conceptions at the summons of teiresias cadmus appears already arrayed like him in the appointed ornaments in all their odd contrast with the infirmity and staidness of old age even in old mens veins the spring leaps again and they are more than ready to begin dancing but they are shy of the untried dress and one of them is blindpoi dei choreuein poi kathistanai poda kai krata seisai polion and then the difficulty of the way the long steep journey to the glens may pilgrims boil their peas might they proceed to the place in carriages at last while the audience laugh more or less delicately at their aged fumblings in some cooperative manner the eyes of the one combining with the hands of the other the pair are about to set forth here pentheus is seen approaching the palace in extreme haste he has been absent from home and returning has just heard of the state of things at thebesthe strange malady of the women the dancings the arrival of the mysterious stranger he finds all the women departed from the town and sees cadmus and teiresias in masque like the exaggerated diabolical figures in some of the religious plays and imageries of the middle age he is an impersonation of stupid impiety one of those whom the gods willing to destroy first infatuate alternating between glib unwisdom and coarse mockery between violence and a pretence of moral austerity he understands only the sorriest motives thinks the whole thing feigned and fancies the stranger so effeminate so attractive of women with whom he remains day and night but a poor sensual creature and the real motive of the bacchic women the indulgence of their lust his ridiculous old grandfather he is ready to renounce and accuses teiresias of having in view only some fresh source of professional profit to himself in connexion with some newfangled oracle his petty spite avenges itself on the prophet by an order to root up the sacred chair where he sits to watch the birds for divination and disturb the order of his sacred place and even from the moment of his entrance the mark of his doom seems already set upon him in an impotent trembling which others notice in him those of the women who still loitered he has already caused to be shut up in the common prison the others with ino autonoe and his own mother agave he will hunt out of the glens while the stranger is threatened with various cruel forms of death but teiresias and cadmus stay to reason with him and induce him to abide wisely with them the prophet fittingly becomes the interpreter of dionysus and explains the true nature of the visitor his divinity the completion or counterpart of that of demeter his gift of prophecy all the soothing influences he brings with him above all his gift of the medicine of sleep to weary mortals but the reason of pentheus is already sickening and the judicial madness gathering over it teiresias and cadmus can but so again not without the laughter of the audience supporting each other a little grotesquely against a fall they get away at last and then again as in those quaintly carved and coloured imageries of the middle agethe martyrdom of the youthful saint firmin for instance round the choir at amienscomes the full contrast with a quite medieval simplicity and directness between the insolence of the tyrant now at last in sight of his prey and the outraged beauty of the youthful god meek surrounded by his enemies like some fair wild creature in the snare of the hunter dionysus has been taken prisoner he is led on to the stage with his hands bound but still holding the thyrsus unresisting he had submitted himself to his captors his colour had not changed with a smile he had bidden them do their will so that even they are touched with awe and are almost ready to admit his divinity marvellously white and red he stands there and now unwilling to be revealed to the unworthy and requiring a fitness in the receiver he represents himself in answer to the inquiries of pentheus not as dionysus but simply as the gods prophet in full trust in whom he desires to hear his sentence then the long hair falls to the ground under the shears the mystic wand is torn from his hand and he is led away to be tied up like some dangerous wild animal in a dark place near the kings stables up to this point in the play there has been a noticeable ambiguity as to the person of dionysus the main figure of the piece he is in part dionysus indeed but in part only his messenger or minister preparing his way a certain harshness of effect in the actual appearance of a god upon the stage being in this way relieved or made easy as by a gradual revelation in two steps to pentheus in his invincible ignorance his essence remains to the last unrevealed and even the women of the chorus seem to understand in him so far only the forerunner of their real leader as he goes away bound therefore they too threatened also in their turn with slavery invoke his greater original to appear and deliver them in pathetic cries they reproach thebes for rejecting themti m anainei ti me pheugeis yet they foretell his future greatness a new orpheus he will more than renew that old miraculous reign over animals and plants their song is full of suggestions of wood and river it is as if for a moment dionysus became the suffering vine again and the rustle of the leaves and water come through their words to refresh it the fountain of dirce still haunted by the virgins of thebes where the infant god was cooled and washed from the flecks of his fiery birth becomes typical of the coolness of all springs and is made by a really poetic licence the daughter of the distant achelousthe earliest born the father in myth of all greek rivers a giddy sonorous scene of portents and surprises followsa distant exaggerated dramatic reflex of that old thundering tumult of the festival in the vineyardin which dionysus reappears miraculously set free from his bonds first in answer to the deeptoned invocation of the chorus a great voice is heard from within proclaiming him to be the son of semele and zeus then amid the short broken rapturous cries of the women of the chorus proclaiming him master the noise of an earthquake passes slowly the pillars of the palace are seen waving to and fro while the strange memorial fire from the tomb of semele blazes up and envelopes the whole building the terrified women fling themselves on the ground and then at last as the place is shaken open dionysus is seen stepping out from among the tottering masses of the mimic palace bidding them arise and fear not but just here comes a long pause in the action of the play in which we must listen to a messenger newly arrived from the glens to tell us what he has seen there among the maenads the singular somewhat sinister beauty of this speech and a similar one subsequenta fair description of morning on the mountaintops with the bacchic women sleeping which turns suddenly to a hard coarse picture of animals cruelly rentis one of the special curiosities which distinguish this play and as it is wholly narrative i shall give it in english prose abbreviating here and there some details which seem to have but a metrical value and thy mother when she heard the lowing of the kine stood up in the midst of them and cried to them to shake off sleep and they casting slumber from their eyes started upright a marvel of beauty and order young and old and maidens yet unmarried and first they let fall their hair upon their shoulders and those whose cinctures were unbound recomposed the spotted fawnskins knotting them about with snakes which rose and licked them on the chin some lately mothers who with breasts still swelling had left their babes behind nursed in their arms antelopes or wild whelps of wolves and yielded them their milk to drink and upon their heads they placed crowns of ivy or of oak or of flowering convolvulus then one taking a thyrsuswand struck with it upon a rock and thereupon leapt out a fine rain of water another let down a reed upon the earth and a fount of wine was sent forth there and those whose thirst was for a white stream skimming the surface with their fingertips gathered from it abundance of milk and from the ivy of the mystic wands streams of honey distilled verily hadst thou seen these things thou wouldst have worshipped whom now thou revilest a grotesque scene follows in which the humour we noted on seeing those two old men diffidently set forth in chaplet and fawn skin deepens into a profound tragic irony pentheus is determined to go out in arms against the bacchanals and put them to death when a sudden desire seizes him to witness them in their encampment upon the mountains dionysus whom he still supposes to be but a prophet or messenger of the god engages to conduct him thither and for greater security among the dangerous women proposes that he shall disguise himself in female attire as pentheus goes within for that purpose he lingers for a moment behind him and in prophetic speech declares the approaching endthe victim has fallen into the net and he goes in to assist at the toilet to array him in the ornaments which he will carry to hades destroyed by his own mothers hands it is characteristic of euripidespart of his fine tact and subtletyto relieve and justify what seems tedious or constrained or merely terrible and grotesque by a suddenly suggested trait of homely pathos or a glimpse of natural beauty or a morsel of form or colour seemingly taken directly from picture or sculpture so here in this fantastic scene our thoughts are changed in a moment by the singing of the chorus and divert for a while to the darkhaired tresses of the wood the breath of the riverside is upon us beside it a fawn escaped from the hunters net is flying swiftly in its joy like it the maenad rushes along and we see the little head thrown back upon the neck in deep aspiration to drink in the dew meantime pentheus has assumed his disguise and comes forth tricked up with false hair and the dress of a bacchanal but still with some misgivings at the thought of going thus attired through the streets of thebes and with many laughable readjustments of the unwonted articles of clothing and with the womans dress his madness is closing faster round him just before in the palace terrified at the noise of the earthquake he had drawn sword upon a mere fantastic appearance and pierced only the empty air now he begins to see the sun double and thebes with all its towers repeated while his conductor seems to him transformed into a wild beast and now and then we come upon some touches of a curious psychology so that we might almost seem to be reading a modern poet as if euripides had been aware of a not unknown symptom of incipient madness in which the patient losing the sense of resistance while lifting small objects imagines himself to be raising enormous weights pentheus as he lifts the thyrsus fancies he could lift cithaeron with all the bacchanals upon it at all this the laughter of course will pass round the theatre while those who really pierce into the purpose of the poet shudder as they see the victim thus grotesquely clad going to his doom already foreseen in the ominous chant of the chorusand as it were his graveclothes in the dress which makes him ridiculous presently a messenger arrives to announce that pentheus is dead and then another curious narrative sets forth the manner of his death full of wild coarse revolting details of course not without pathetic touches and with the loveliness of the serving maenads and of their mountain solitudestheir trees and waternever quite forgotten it describes how venturing as a spy too near the sacred circle pentheus was fallen upon like a wild beast by the mystic huntresses and torn to pieces his mother being the first to begin and at last agave herself comes upon the stage holding aloft the head of her son fixed upon the sharp end of the thyrsus calling upon the women of the chorus to welcome the revel of the evian god who accordingly admit her into the company professing themselves her fellowrevellers the bacchanals being thus absorbed into the chorus for the rest of the play for indeed all through it the true though partly suppressed relation of the chorus to the bacchanals is this that the women of the chorus staid and temperate for the moment following dionysus in his alternations are but the paler sisters of his more wild and gloomy votariesthe true followers of the mystical dionysusthe real chorus of zagreus the idea that their violent proceedings are the result of madness only sent on them as a punishment for their original rejection of the god being as i said when seen from the deeper motives of the myth only a of euripidesa piece of rationalism of which he avails himself for the purpose of softening down the tradition of which he has undertaken to be the poet agave comes on the stage then bloodstained exulting in her still quite visibly mad indeed and with the outward signs of madness and as her mind wanders musing still on the fancy that the dead head in her hands is that of a lion she has slain among the mountainsa young lion she avers as she notices the down on the young mans chin and his abundant haira fancy in which the chorus humour her willing to deal gently with the poor distraught creature supported by them she rejoices declaring herself in such goodly spoil priding herself that the victim has been slain not with iron weapons but with her own white fingers she summons all thebes to come and behold she calls for her aged father to draw near and see and for pentheus himself at last that he may mount and rivet her trophy appropriately decorative there between the triglyphs of the cornice below the roof visible to all and now from this point onwards dionysus himself becomes more and more clearly discernible as the hunter a wily hunter and man the prey he hunts for cry the chorus as they unite in agaves triumph and give their sanction to her deed and as the bacchanals supplement the chorus and must be added to it to make the conception of it complete so in the conception of dionysus also a certain transference or substitution must be made much of the horror and sorrow of agave of pentheus of the whole tragic situation must be transferred to him if we wish to realise in the older profounder and more complete sense of his nature that mystical being of greek tradition to whom all these experienceshis madness the chase his imprisonment and death his peace again really belong and to discern which through euripides peculiar treatment of his subject is part of the curious interest of this play through the sophism of euripides for that again is the really descriptive word with which euripides a lover of sophisms as aristophanes knows himself supplies us wellthis softened version of the bacchic madness is a sophism of euripides and dionysus omophagusthe eater of raw flesh must be added to the golden image of dionysus meilichiusthe honeysweet if the old tradition in its completeness is to be in spite of that sophism our closing impression if we are to catch in its fulness that deep undercurrent of horror which runs below all through this masque of spring and realise the spectacle of that wild chase in which dionysus is ultimately both the hunter and the spoil but meantime another person appears on the stage cadmus enters followed by attendants bearing on a bier the torn limbs of pentheus which lying wildly scattered through the tangled wood have been with difficulty collected and now decently put together and covered over in the little that still remains before the end of the play destiny now hurrying things rapidly forward and strong emotions hopes and forebodings being now closely packed euripides has before him an artistic problem of enormous difficulty perhaps this very haste and closepacking of the matter which keeps the mind from dwelling overmuch on detail relieves its real extravagance and those who read it carefully will think that the pathos of euripides has been equal to the occasion in a few profoundly designed touches he depicts the perplexity of cadmus in whose house a god had become an inmate only to destroy itthe regret of the old man for the one male child to whom that house had looked up as the pillar whereby aged people might feel secure the piteous craziness of agave the unconscious irony with which she caresses the florid youthful head of her son the delicate breaking of the thing to her reviving intelligence as cadmus though he can but wish that she might live on for ever in her visionary enjoyment prepares the way by playing on that other horrible legend of the theban house the tearing of actaeon to deathhe too destroyed by a god he gives us the sense of agaves gradual return to reason through many glimmering doubts till she wakes up at last to find the real face turned up towards the mother and murderess the quite naturally spontaneous sorrow of the mother ending with her confession down to her last sigh and the final breaking up of the house of cadmus with a result so genuine heartfelt and dignified withal in its expression of a strange ineffable woe that a fragment of it the lamentation of agave over her son in which the longpent agony at last finds vent were it is supposed adopted into his paler work by an early christian poet and have figured since as touches of real fire in the

ti me pheugeis translation bacchae euripidis fabulae ed gilbert murray vol oxford clarendon press the myth of demeter and persephone i no chapter in the history of human imagination is more curious than the myth of demeter and kore or persephone alien in some respects from the genuine traditions of greek mythology a relic of the earlier inhabitants of greece and having but a subordinate place in the religion of homer it yet asserted its interest little by little and took a complex hold on the minds of the greeks becoming finally the central and most popular subject of their national worship following its changes we come across various phases of greek culture which are not without their likenesses in the modern mind we trace it in the dim first period of instinctive popular conception we see it connecting itself with many impressive elements of art and poetry and religious custom with the picturesque superstitions of the many and with the finer intuitions of the few and besides this it is in itself full of interest and suggestion to all for whom the ideas of the greek religion have any real meaning in the modern world and the fortune of the myth has not deserted it in later times in the year the longlost text of the homeric hymn to demeter was discovered among the manuscripts of the imperial library at moscow and in our own generation the tact of an eminent student of greek art sir charles newton has restored to the world the buried treasures of the little temple and precinct of demeter at cnidus which have many claims to rank in the central order of greek sculpture the present essay is an attempt to select and weave together for those who are now approaching the deeper study of greek thought whatever details in the development of this myth arranged with a view rather to a total impression than to the debate of particular points may seem likely to increase their stock of poetical impressions and to add to this some criticisms on the expression which it has left of itself in extant art and poetry the central expression then of the story of demeter and persephone is the homeric hymn to which grote has assigned a date at least as early as six hundred years before christ the one survivor of a whole family of hymns on this subject it was written perhaps for one of those contests which took place on the seventh day of the eleusinian festival and in which a bunch of ears of corn was the prize perhaps for actual use in the mysteries themselves by the hierophantes or interpreter who showed to the worshippers at eleusis those sacred places to which the poem contains so many references about the composition itself there are many difficult questions with various surmises as to why it has remained only in this unique manuscript of the end of the fourteenth century portions of the text are missing and there are probably some additions by later hands yet most scholars have admitted that it possesses some of the true characteristics of the homeric style some genuine echoes of the age immediately succeeding that which produced the iliad and the odyssey listen now to a somewhat abbreviated version of it says the prizepoet or the interpreter the sacristan of the holy placesso long as she could still see the earth and the sky and the sea with the great waves moving and the beams of the sun and still thought to see again her mother and the race of the everliving gods so long hope soothed her in the midst of her grief the peaks of the hills and the depths of the sea echoed her cry and the mother heard it a sharp pain seized her at the heart she plucked the veil from her hair and cast down the blue hood from her shoulders and fled forth like a bird seeking persephone over dry land and sea but neither man nor god would tell her the truth nor did any bird come to her as a sure messenger then a more terrible grief took possession of demeter and in her anger against zeus she forsook the assembly of the gods and abode among men for a long time veiling her beauty under a worn countenance so that none who looked upon her knew her until she came to the house of celeus who was then king of eleusis in her sorrow she sat down at the wayside by the virgins well where the people of eleusis come to draw water under the shadow of an olive tree she seemed as an aged woman whose time of childbearing is gone by and from whom the gifts of aphrodite have been withdrawn like one of the hired servants who nurse the children or keep house in kings palaces and the daughters of celeus four of them like goddesses possessing the flower of their youth callidice cleisidice demo and callithoe the eldest of them coming to draw water that they might bear it in their brazen pitchers to their fathers house saw demeter and knew her not the gods are hard for men to recognise demeter bowed her head in assent and they having filled their shining vessels with water bore them away rejoicing in their beauty they came quickly to their fathers house and told their mother what they had seen and heard their mother bade them return and hire the woman for a great price and they like the hinds or young heifers leaping in the fields in spring fulfilled with the pasture holding up the folds of their raiment sped along the hollow roadway their hair in colour like the crocus floating about their shoulders as they went they found the glorious goddess still sitting by the wayside unmoved then they led her to their fathers house and she veiled from head to foot in her deep grief followed them on the way and her blue robe gathered itself as she walked in many folds about her feet they came to the house and passed through the sunny porch where their mother metaneira was sitting against one of the pillars of the roof having a young child in her bosom they ran up to her but demeter crossed the threshold and as she passed through her head rose and touched the roof and her presence filled the doorway with a divine brightness but the foolishness of his mother prevented it for a suspicion growing up within her she awaited her time and one night peeped in upon them and thereupon cried out in terror at what she saw and the goddess heard her and a sudden anger seizing her she plucked the child from the fire and cast it on the groundthe child she would fain have made immortal but who must now share the common destiny of all men though some inscrutable grace should still be his because he had lain for awhile on the knees and in the bosom of the goddess so all night trembling with fear they sought to propitiate the glorious goddess and in the morning they told all to their father celeus and he according to the commands of the goddess built a fair temple and all the people assisted and when it was finished every man departed to his own home then demeter returned and sat down within the templewalls and remained still apart from the company of the gods alone in her wasting regret for her daughter persephone so they spent all that day together in intimate communion having many things to hear and tell then zeus sent to them rhea his venerable mother the oldest of divine persons to bring them back reconciled to the company of the gods and he ordained that persephone should remain two parts of the year with her mother and one third part only with her husband in the kingdom of the dead so demeter suffered the earth to yield its fruits once more and the land was suddenly laden with leaves and flowers and waving corn also she visited triptolemus and the other princes of eleusis and instructed them in the performance of her sacred ritesthose mysteries of which no tongue may speak only blessed is he whose eyes have seen them his lot after death is not as the lot of other mengarment of godout of his

seeds of things disparted into their places the lighter elements are borne aloft the heavier fall to the centre the air grows bright with heat a blazing light whirls round the firmament the sea flows the earth hangs suspended in its place and there were divers colours in it she illuminated the stars with gold infused a purple shade into the water and heightened the shore with gems of flowers and under her skilful hand the threads with their inwrought lustre swell up in momentary counterfeit of the waves you might think that the sea wind flapped against the rocks and that a hollow murmur came creeping over the thirsty sands she puts in the five zones marking with a red ground the midmost zone possessed by burning heat its outline was parched and stiff the threads seemed thirsty with the constant sunshine on either side lay the two zones proper for human life where a gentle temperance reigns and at the extremes she drew the twin zones of numbing cold making her work dun and sad with the hues of perpetual frost she paints in too the sacred places of dis her fathers brother and the manes so fatal to her and an omen of her doom was not wanting for as she worked as if with foreknowledge of the future her face became wet with a sudden burst of tears and now in the utmost border of the tissue she had begun to wind in the wavy line of the river oceanus with its glassy shallows but the door sounds on its hinges and she perceives the goddesses coming the unfinished work drops from her hands and a ruddy blush lights up in her clear and snowwhite faceworship of sorrowafter many wanderings ceres was come to attica there in the utmost dejection for the first time she sat down to rest on a bare stone which the people of attica still call the stone of sorrow for many days she remained there motionless under the open sky heedless of the rain and of the frosty moonlight places have their fortunes and what is now the illustrious town of eleusis was then the field of an old man named celeus he was carrying home a load of acorns and wild berries shaken down from the brambles and dry wood for burning on the hearth his little daughter was leading two goats home from the hills and at home there was a little boy lying sick in his cradle mother said the little girland the goddess was moved at the name of motherwhat do you all alone in this solitary place the old man stopped too in spite of his heavy burden and bade her take shelter in his cottage though it was but a little one but at first she refused to come she looked like an old woman and an old womans coif confined her hair and as the man still urged her she said to him heaven bless you and may children always be yours my daughter has been stolen from me alas how much happier is your lot than mine and though weeping is impossible for the gods as she spoke a bright drop like a tear fell into her bosom softhearted the little girl and the old man weep together and after that the good man said arise despise not the shelter of my little home so may the daughter whom you seek be restored to you lead me answered the goddess you have found out the secret of moving me and she arose from the stone and followed the old man and as they went he told her of the sick child at homehow he is restless with pain and cannot sleep and she before entering the little cottage gathered from the untended earth the soothing and sleepgiving poppy and as she gathered it it is said that she forgot her vow and tasted of the seeds and broke her long fast unaware as she came through the door she saw the house full of trouble for now there was no more hope of life for the sick boy she saluted the mother whose name was metaneira and humbly kissed the lips of the child with her own lips then the paleness left its face and suddenly the parents see the strength returning to its body so great is the force that comes from the divine mouth and the whole family was full of joythe mother and the father and the little girl they were the whole household three profound ethical conceptions three impressive sacred figures have now defined themselves for the greek imagination condensed from all the traditions which have now been traced from the hymns of the poets from the instinctive and unformulated mysticism of primitive minds demeter is become the divine sorrowing mother kore the goddess of summer is become persephone the goddess of death still associated with the forms and odours of flowers and fruit yet as one risen from the dead also presenting one side of her ambiguous nature to mens gloomier fancies thirdly there is the image of demeter enthroned chastened by sorrow and somewhat advanced in age blessing the earth in her joy at the return of kore the myth has now entered on the third phase of its life in which it becomes the property of those more elevated spirits who in the decline of the greek religion pick and choose and modify with perfect freedom of mind whatever in it may seem adapted to minister to their culture in this way the myths of the greek religion become parts of an ideal visible embodiments of the susceptibilities and intuitions of the nobler kind of souls and it is to this latest phase of mythological development that the highest greek sculpture allies itself its function is to give visible aesthetic expression to the constituent parts of that ideal as poetry dealt chiefly with the incidents of the story so it is with the personages of the storywith demeter and kore themselvesthat sculpture has to do for the myth of demeter like the greek religion in general had its unlovelier side grotesque unhellenic unglorified by art illustrated well enough by the description pausanias gives us of his visit to the cave of the black demeter at phigalia in his time the image itself had vanished but he tells us enough about it to enable us to realise its general characteristics monstrous as the special legend with which it was connected the black draperies the horses head united to the womans body with the carved reptiles creeping about it if with the thought of this gloomy image of our mother the earth in our minds we take up one of those coins which bear the image of kore or demeter we shall better understand what the function of sculpture really was in elevating and refining the religious conceptions of the greeks looking on the profile for instance on one of those coins of messene which almost certainly represent demeter and noting the crisp chaste opening of the lips the minutely wrought earrings and the delicately touched ears of cornthis trifling object being justly regarded as in its aesthetic qualities an epitome of art on a larger scalewe shall see how far the imagination of the greeks had travelled from what their black demeter shows us had once been possible for them and in making the gods of their worship the objects of a worthy companionship in their thoughts certainly the mind of the old workman who struck that coin was if we may trust the testimony of his work unclouded by impure or gloomy shadows the thought of demeter is impressed here with all the purity and proportion the purged and dainty intelligence of the human countenance the mystery of it is indeed absent perhaps could hardly have been looked for in so slight a thing intended for no sacred purpose and tossed lightly from hand to hand but in his firm hold on the harmonies of the human face the designer of this tranquil head of demeter is on the one road to a command over the secrets of all imaginative pathos and mystery though in the perfect fairness and blitheness of his work he might seem almost not to have known the incidents of her terrible story it is probable that at a later period than in other equally important temples of greece the earlier archaic representation of demeter in the sanctuary of eleusis was replaced by a more beautiful image in the new style with face and hands of ivory having therefore in tone and texture some subtler likeness to womens flesh and the closely enveloping drapery being constructed in daintily beaten plates of gold praxiteles seems to have been the first to bring into the region of a freer artistic handling these shy deities of the earth shrinking still within the narrow restraints of a hieratic conventional treatment long after the more genuine olympians had broken out of them the school of praxiteles as distinguished from that of pheidias is especially the school of grace relaxing a little the severe ethical tension of the latter in favour of a slightly asiatic sinuosity and tenderness pausanias tells us that he carved the two goddesses for the temple of demeter at athens and pliny speaks of two groups of his in brass the one representing the stealing of persephone the other her later annual descent into hades conducted thither by the now pacified mother all alike have perished though perhaps some more or less faint reflexion of the most important of these designs may still be traced on many painted vases which depict the stealing of persephonea helpless plucked flower in the arms of aidoneus and in this almost traditional form the subject was often represented in low relief on tombs some of which still remain in one or two instances built up oddly enough in the walls of christian churches on the tombs of women who had died in early life this was a favourite subject some likeness of the actual lineaments of the deceased being sometimes transferred to the features of persephone yet so far it might seem when we consider the interest of this story in itself and its importance in the greek religion that no adequate expression of it had remained to us in works of art but in the year the discovery of the marbles in the sacred precinct of demeter at cnidus restored to us an illustration of the myth in its artistic phase hardly less central than the homeric hymn in its poetical phase with the help of the descriptions and plans of mr newtons book we can form as one always wishes to do in such cases a clear idea of the place where these marblesthree statues of the best style of greek sculpture now in the british museumwere found occupying a ledge of rock looking towards the sea at the base of a cliff of upheaved limestone of singular steepness and regularity of surface the spot presents indications of volcanic disturbance as if a chasm in the earth had opened here it was this character suggesting the belief in an actual connexion with the interior of the earth which probably gave rise as in other cases where the landscape presented some peculiar feature in harmony with the story to the dedication upon it of a house and an image of demeter with whom were associated kore and hoi theoi para damatriaidoneus and the mystical or chthonian dionysus the house seems to have been a small chapel only of simple construction and designed for private use the site itself having been private property consecrated by a particular family for their own religious uses although other persons servants or dependents of the founders may also have frequented it the architecture seems to have been insignificant but the sculpture costly and exquisite belonging if contemporary with the erection of the building to a great period of greek art of which also it is judged to possess intrinsic marksabout the year before christ the probable date of the dedication of the little temple the artists by whom these works were produced were therefore either the contemporaries of praxiteles whose venus was for many centuries the glory of cnidus or belonged to the generation immediately succeeding him the temple itself was probably thrown down by a renewal of the volcanic disturbances the statues however remaining and the ministers and worshippers still continuing to make shift for their sacred business in the place now doubly venerable but with its temple unrestored down to the second or third century of the christian era its frequenters being now perhaps mere chance comers the family of the original donors having become extinct or having deserted it into this later arrangement clearly divined by mr newton through those faint indications which mean much for true experts the extant remains as they were found upon the spot permit us to enter it is one of the graves of that old religion but with much still fresh in it we see it with its provincial superstitions and its curious magic rites but also with its means of really solemn impressions in the culminating forms of greek art the two faces of the greek religion confronting each other here and the whole having that rare peculiarity of a kind of personal stamp upon it the place having been designed to meet the fancies of one particular soul or at least of one family it is always difficult to bring the every day aspect of greek religion home to us but even the slighter details of this little sanctuary help us to do this and knowing so little as we do of the greater mysteries of demeter this glance into an actual religious place dedicated to her and with the air of her worship still about it is doubly interesting the little votive figures of the goddesses in baked earth were still lying stored in the small treasury intended for such objects or scattered about the feet of the images together with lamps in great number a lighted lamp being a favourite offering in memory of the torches with which demeter sought persephone or from some sense of inherent darkness in these gods of the earth those torches in the hands of demeter being indeed originally the artificial warmth and brightness of lamp and fire on winter nights the dirae or spellskatadesmoi binding or devoting certain persons to the infernal gods inscribed on thin rolls of lead with holes sometimes for hanging them up about those quiet statues still lay just as they were left anywhere within the sacred precinct illustrating at once the gloomier side of the greek religion in general and of demeter and persephone especially in their character of avenging deities and as relics of ancient magic reproduced so strangely at other times and places reminding us of the permanence of certain odd ways of human thought a woman binds with her spell the person who seduces her husband away from her and her children another the person who has accused her of preparing poison for her husband another devotes one who has not restored a borrowed garment or has stolen a bracelet or certain drinkinghorns and from some instances we might infer that this was a favourite place of worship for the poor and ignorant in this living picture we find still lingering on at the foot of the beautiful greek marbles that phase of religious temper which a cynical mind might think a truer link of its unity and permanence than any higher aesthetic instinctsa phase of it which the art of sculpture humanising and refining mans conceptions of the unseen tended constantly to do away for the higher side of the greek religion thus humanised and refined by art and elevated by it to the sense of beauty is here also there were three ideal forms as we saw gradually shaping themselves in the development of the story of demeter waiting only for complete realisation at the hands of the sculptor and now with these forms in our minds let us place ourselves in thought before the three images which once probably occupied the three niches or ambries in the face of that singular cliff at cnidus one of them being then wrought on a larger scale of the three figures one probably represents persephone as the goddess of the dead the second demeter enthroned the third is probably a portraitstatue of a priestess of demeter but may perhaps even so represent demeter herself demeter achaea ceres deserta the mater dolorosa of the greeks a type not as yet recognised in any other work of ancient art certainly it seems hard not to believe that this work is in some way connected with the legend of the place to which it belonged and the main subject of which it realises so completely and at least it shows how the higher greek sculpture would have worked out this motive if demeter at all it is demeter the seekerdêôas she was called in the mysteries in some pause of her restless wandering over the world in search of the lost child and become at last an abstract type of the wanderer the homeric hymn as we saw had its sculptural motives the great gestures of demeter who was ever the stately goddess as she followed the daughters of celeus or sat by the wellside or went out and in through the halls of the palace expressed in monumental words with the sentiment of that monumental homeric presence this statue is penetrated uniting a certain solemnity of attitude and bearing to a profound piteousness an unrivalled pathos of expression there is something of the pity of michelangelos mater dolorosa in the wasted form and marred countenance yet with the light breaking faintly over it from the eyes which contrary to the usual practice in ancient sculpture are represented as looking upwards it is the aged woman who has escaped from pirates who has but just escaped being sold as a slave calling on the young for pity the sorrows of her long wanderings seem to have passed into the marble and in this too it meets the demands which the reader of the homeric hymn with its command over the resources of human pathos makes upon the sculptor the tall figure in proportion above the ordinary height is veiled and clad to the feet in the longer tunic its numerous folds hanging in heavy parallel lines opposing the lines of the peplus or cloak which cross it diagonally over the breast enwrapping the upper portion of the body somewhat closely it is the very type of the wandering woman going grandly indeed as homer describes her yet so human in her anguish that we seem to recognise some far descended shadow of her in the homely figure of the roughly clad french peasant woman who in one of corots pictures is hasting along under a sad light as the day goes out behind the little hill we have watched the growth of the merely personal sentiment in the story and we may notice that if this figure be indeed demeter then the conception of her has become wholly humanised no trace of the primitive cosmical import of the myth no colour or scent of the mystical earth remains about it the seated figure much mutilated and worn by long exposure yet possessing according to the best critics marks of the school of praxiteles is almost undoubtedly the image of demeter enthroned three times in the homeric hymn she is represented as sitting once by the fountain at the wayside again in the house of celeus and again in the newly finished temple of eleusis but always in sorrow seated on the petra agelastos which as ovid told us the people of attica still called the stone of sorrow here she is represented in her later state of reconciliation enthroned as the glorified mother of all things the delicate plaiting of the tunic about the throat the formal curling of the hair and a certain weight of overthoughtfulness in the brows recall the manner of leonardo da vinci a master one of whose characteristics is a very sensitive expression of the sentiment of maternity it reminds one especially of a work by one of his scholars the virgin of the balances in the louvre a picture which has been thought to represent under a veil the blessing of universal nature and in which the sleepylooking heads with a peculiar grace and refinement of somewhat advanced life in them have just this halfweary posture we see here then the here of the world below the stygian juno the chief of those elysian matrons who come crowding in the poem of claudian to the marriage toilet of proserpine the goddess of the fertility of the earth and of all creatures but still of fertility as arisen out of death and therefore she is not without a certain pensiveness having seen the seed fall into the ground and die many times persephone is returned to her and the hair spreads like a rich harvest over her shoulders but she is still veiled and knows that the seed must fall into the ground again and persephone descend again from her the statues of the supposed priestess and of the enthroned demeter are of more than the size of life the figure of persephone is but seventeen inches high a daintily handled toy of parian marble the miniature copy perhaps of a much larger work which might well be reproduced on a magnified scale the conception of demeter is throughout chiefly human and even domestic though never without a hieratic interest because she is not a goddess only but also a priestess in contrast persephone is wholly unearthly the close companion and even the confused double of hecate the goddess of midnight terrorsdespoenathe final mistress of all that lives and as sorrow is the characteristic sentiment of demeter so awe of persephone she is compact of sleep and death and flowers but of narcotic flowers especiallya revenant who in the garden of aidoneus has eaten of the pomegranate and bears always the secret of decay in her of return to the grave in the mystery of those swallowed seeds sometimes in later work holding in her hand the key of the great prisonhouse but which unlocks all secrets also sometimes like demeter the poppy emblem of sleep and death by its narcotic juices of life and resurrection by its innumerable seeds of the dreams therefore that may intervene between falling asleep and waking treated as it is in the homeric hymn and still more in this statue the image of persephone may be regarded as the result of many efforts to lift the old chthonian gloom still lingering on in heavier souls concerning the grave to connect it with impressions of dignity and beauty and a certain sweetness even it is meant to make men in love or at least at peace with death the persephone of praxiteles school then is aphroditepersephone venuslibitina her shadowy eyes have gazed upon the fainter colouring of the under world and the tranquillity born of it has for the greek hades is after all but a quiet twilight place not very different from that house of fame where dante places the great souls of the classical world aidoneus himself being conceived in the highest greek sculpture as but a gentler zeus the great innkeeper so that when a certain greek sculptor had failed in his portraiture of zeus because it had too little hilarity too little in the eyes and brow of the open and cheerful sky he only changed its title and the thing passed excellently with its heavy locks and shadowy eyebrows for the god of the dead the image of persephone then as it is here composed with the tall towerlike headdress from which the veil dependsthe cornbasket originally carried thus by the greek women balanced on the headgiving the figure unusual length has the air of a body bound about with grave clothes while the archaic hands and feet and a certain stiffness in the folds of the drapery give it something of a hieratic character and to the modern observer may suggest a sort of kinship with the more chastened kind of gothic work but quite of the school of praxiteles is the general character of the composition the graceful waving of the hair the fine shadows of the little face of the eyes and lips especially like the shadows of a flowera flower risen noiselessly from its dwelling in the dustthough still with that fulness or heaviness in the brow as of sleepy people which in the delicate gradations of greek sculpture distinguish the infernal deities from their olympian kindred the object placed in the hand may be perhaps a stiff archaic flower but is probably the partly consumed pomegranateone morsel gone the most usual emblem of persephone being this mystical fruit which because of the multitude of its seeds was to the romans a symbol of fecundity and was sold at the doors of the temple of ceres that the women might offer it there and bear numerous children and so to the middle age became a symbol of the fruitful earth itself and then of that other seed sown in the dark underworld and at last of that whole hidden region so thickly sown which dante visited michelino painting him in the duomo of florence with this fruit in his hand and botticelli putting it into the childish hands of him who if men there is an attractiveness in these goddesses of the earth akin to the influence of cool places quiet houses subdued light tranquillising voices what is there in this phase of ancient religion for us at the present day the myth of demeter and persephone then illustrates the power of the greek religion as a religion of pure ideasof conceptions which having no link on historical fact yet because they arose naturally out of the spirit of man and embodied in adequate symbols his deepest thoughts concerning the conditions of his physical and spiritual life maintained their hold through many changes and are still not without a solemnising power even for the modern mind which has once admitted them as recognised and habitual inhabitants and abiding thus for the elevation and purifying of our sentiments long after the earlier and simpler races of their worshippers have passed away they may be a

credible or practicable thing and yet pausanias visits greece under conditions as favourable for observation as those under which later travellers addison or eustace proceed to italy for him the impress of life in those old greek cities is not less vivid and entire than that of medieval italy to ourselves at siena for instance with its ancient palaces still in occupation its public edifices as serviceable as if the old republic had but just now vacated them the tradition of their primitive worship still unbroken in its churches had the opportunities in which pausanias was fortunate been ours how many haunts of the antique greek life unnoticed by him we should have peeped into minutely systematic in our painstaking how many a view would broaden out where he notes hardly anything at all on his map of greece one of the most curious phases of greek civilisation which has thus perished for us and regarding which as we may fancy we should have made better use of that old travellers facilities is the early attic demelifeits picturesque intensely localised variety in the hollow or on the spur of mountain or seashore and with it many a relic of primitive religion many an early growth of art parallel to what vasari records of artistic beginnings in the smaller cities of italy colonus and acharnae surviving still so vividly by the magic of sophocles of aristophanes are but isolated examples of a widespread manner of life in which amid many provincial peculiarities the first yet perhaps the most costly and telling steps were made in all the various departments of greek culture even in the days of pausanias piraeus was still traceable as a distinct township once the possible rival of athens with its little old covered market by the seaside and the symbolical picture of the place its genius visible on the wall and that is but the type of what there had been to know of threescore and more village communities each having its own altars its special worship and place of civic assembly its trade and crafts its name drawn from physical peculiarity or famous incident its body of heroic tradition lingering on while athens the great deme gradually absorbed into itself more and more of their achievements and passing away almost completely as political factors in the peloponnesian war they were still felt we can hardly doubt in the actual physiognomy of greece that variety in unity which its singular geographical formation secured to greece as a whole was at its utmost in these minute reflexions of the national character with all the relish of local differencenew art new poetry fresh ventures in political combination in the conception of life springing as if straight from the soil like the thornblossom of early spring in magic lines over all that rocky land on the other hand it was just here that ancient habits clung most tenaciouslythat oldfashioned homely delightful existence to which the refugee pent up in athens in the years of the peloponnesian war looked back so fondly if the impression of greece generally is but enhanced by the littleness of the physical scene of events intellectually so greatsuch a system of grand lines restrained within so narrow a compass as in one of its fine coinsstill more would this be true of those centres of country life here certainly was that assertion of seemingly small interests which brings into free play and gives his utmost value to the individual making his warfare equally with his more peaceful rivalries deme against deme the mountain against the plain the seashore tangible as a personal history to the doubling of its fascination for those whose business is with the survey of the dramatic side of life as with civil matters so it was also we may fairly suppose with religion the demelife was a manifestation of religious custom and sentiment in all their primitive local variety as athens gradually drawing into itself the various elements of provincial culture developed with authority the central religious position the demesmen did but add the worship of athene polias the goddess of the capital to their own preexistent ritual uses of local and central religion alike time and circumstance had obliterated much when pausanias came a devout spirit with religion for his chief interest eager for the trace of a divine footstep anxious even in the days of lucian to deal seriously with what had counted for so much to serious men he has indeed to lament that but the greekhis very name also hellen was the title of a priesthoodhad been religious abundantly sanctifying every detail of his actual life with the religious idea and as pausanias goes on his way he finds many a remnant of that earlier estate of religion when as he fancied it had been nearer the gods as it was certainly nearer the earth it is marked even in decay with varieties of place and is not only continuous but in situ at phigaleia he makes his offerings to demeter agreeably to the paternal rites of the inhabitants wax fruit undressed wool a dream from heaven cuts short his notice of the mysteries of eleusis he sees the stone on which silenus was used to sit and rest at athens the tombs of the amazons of the purplehaired nisus of deucalion the worshippers of poseidon even at his temple among the hills might still feel the earth fluctuating beneath their feet and in care for divine things he tells us the athenians outdid all other greeks even in the days of nero it revealed itself oddly and it is natural to suppose that of this temper the demes as the proper home of conservatism were exceptionally expressive scattered in those remote romantic villages among their olives or seaweeds lay the heroic graves the relics the sacred images often rude enough amid the delicate tribute of later art this too oftentimes finding in such retirement its best inspirations as in some attic fiesole like a network over the land of gracious poetic tradition as also of undisturbed ceremonial usage surviving late for those who cared to seek it the local religions had been never wholly superseded by the worship of the great national temples they were in truth the most characteristic developments of a faith essentially earthborn or indigenous and how often must the student of fine art again wish he had the same sort of knowledge about its earlier growth in greece that he actually possesses in the case of italian art given any development at all in this matter there must have been phases of art which if immature were also veritable expressions of power to come intermediate discoveries of beauty such as are by no means a mere anticipation and of service only as explaining historically larger subsequent achievements but of permanent attractiveness in themselves being often indeed the true maturity of certain amiable artistic qualities and in regard to greek art at its bestthe parthenonno less than to the art of the renaissance at its best the sistine chapelthe more instructive light would be derived rather from what precedes than what follows such central success from the determination to apprehend the fulfilment of past effort rather than the eve of decline in the critical central moment which partakes of both of such early promise early achievement we have in the case of greek art little to compare with what is extant of the youth of the arts in italy overbecks careful gleanings of its history form indeed a sorry relic as contrasted with vasaris intimations of the beginnings of the renaissance fired by certain fragments of its earlier days of a beauty in truth absolute and vainly longing for more the student of greek sculpture indulges the thought of an ideal of youthful energy therein yet withal of youthful selfrestraint and again as with survivals of old religion the privileged home he fancies of that ideal must have been in those venerable attic townships as to a large extent it passed away with them the budding of new art the survival of old religion at isolated centres of provincial life where varieties of human character also were keen abundant asserted in correspondingly effective incident this is what irresistible fancy superinduces on historic details themselves meagre enough the sentiment of antiquity is indeed a characteristic of all cultivated people even in what may seem the freshest ages and not exclusively a humour of our later world in the earliest notices about them as we know the people of attica appear already impressed by the immense antiquity of their occupation of its soil of which they claim to be the very first flower some at least of those old demesmen we may well fancy sentimentally reluctant to change their habits fearful of losing too much of themselves in the larger stream of life clinging to what is antiquated as the work of centralisation goes on needful as that work was with the great already ever in the distance the fear of asia barbaric splendid hardly known yet haunting the curious imagination of those who had borrowed thence the art in which they were rapidly excelling it developing as we now see in the interest of greek humanity crafts begotten of tyrannic and illiberal luxury was finally to suppress the rivalries of those primitive centres of activity when the of the common foe came into sight at a later period civil strife was to destroy their last traces the old hoplite from rhamnus or acharnae pent up in beleaguered athens during that first summer of the peloponnesian war occupying with his household a turret of the wall as thucydides describesone of many picturesque touches in that severe historiancould well remember the ancient provincial life which this conflict with sparta was bringing to an end he could recall his boyish halfscared curiosity concerning those persian ships coming first as merchantmen or with pirates on occasion in the halfsavage wicked splendours of their decoration the monstrous figureheads their glittering freightage men would hardly have trusted their women or children with that suspicious crew hovering through the dusk there were soothsayers indeed who had long foretold what happened soon after giving shape to vague supernatural terrors and then he had crept from his hidingplace with other lads to go view the enemies slain at marathon beside those belated spartans this new war with whom seemed to be reviving the fierce local feuds of his younger days paraloi and diacrioi had ever been rivals very distant it all seemed now with all the stories he could tell for in those crumbling little towns as heroic life had lingered on into the actual so at an earlier date the supernatural into the heroic like mist at dawn the last traces of its divine visitors had then vanished from the land where however they had already begotten it was theseus uncompromising young master of the situation in fearless application of of his day to every phase of life where it was applicable who at the expense of attica had given athens a people reluctant enough in truth as plutarch suggests to desert for this elect youth who thus figures passably as a kind of mythic shorthand for civilisation making roads and the like facilitating travel suppressing various forms of violence but many innocent things as well so it must needs be in a world where even hand in hand with a godassisted hero justice goes blindfold he slays the bull of marathon and many another local tyrant but also exterminates that delightful creature the centaur the amazon whom plato will reinstate as the type of improved womanhood has no better luck than phaea the sowpig of crommyon foul old landedproprietress they exerted however the prerogative of poetic protest and survive thereby centaur and amazon as we see them in the fine art of greece represent the regret of athenians themselves for something that could never be brought to life again and have their pathos those young heroes contending with amazons on the frieze of the mausoleum had best make haste with their bloody work if young peoples eyes can tell a true story a type still of progress triumphant through injustice set on improving things off the face of the earth theseus took occasion to attack the amazons in their mountain home not long after their ruinous conflict with hercules and hit them when they were down that greater bully had laboured off on the worlds highway carrying with him the official girdle of antiope their queen gift of ares and therewith it would seem the mystic secret of their strength at sight of this new foe at any rate she came to a strange submission the savage virgin had turned to very woman and was presently a willing slave returning on the gaily appointed ship in all haste to athens where in supposed wedlock she bore king theseus a son with their annual visitvisit to the gargareansfor the purpose of maintaining their species parting with their boys early these husbandless women could hardly be supposed a very happy certainly not a very joyous people they figure rather as a sorry measure of the luck of the female sex in taking a hard natural law into their own hands and by abnegation of all tender companionship making shift with bare independence as a kind of secondbestthe best practicable by them in the imperfect actual condition of things but the heartstrings would ache still where the breast had been cut away the sisters of antiope had come not immediately but in careful array of battle to bring back the captive all along the weary roads from the caucasus to attica their traces had remained in the great graves of those who died by the way against the little remnant carrying on the fight to the very midst of athens antiope herself had turned all other thoughts transformed now into wild idolatry of her hero superstitious or in real regret the athenians never forgot their tombs as for antiope the conscience of her perfidy remained with her adding the pang of remorse to her own desertion when king theseus with his accustomed bad faith to women set her too aside in turn phaedra the true wife was there peeping suspiciously at her arrival and even as antiope yielded to her lords embraces the thought had come that a male child might be the instrument of her anger and one day judge her cause in one of these doomed decaying villages then king theseus placed the woman and her babe hidden yet secure within the attic border as men veil their mistakes or crimes they might pass away they and their story together with the memory of other antiquated creatures of such places who had had connubial dealings with the stars the white paved waggontrack a bypath of the sacred way to eleusis zigzagged through sloping oliveyards from the plain of silvered blue with athens building in the distance and passed the door of the rude stone house furnished scantily which no one had ventured to inhabit of late years till they came there on the ledges of the grey cliffs above the laurel groves stem and foliage of motionless bronze had spread their tents travellers bound northwards were glad to repose themselves there and take directions or provision for their journey onwards from the highland people who came down hither to sell their honey their cheese and woollen stuff in the tiny marketplace at dawn the great stars seemed to halt a while burning as if for sacrifice to some pure deity on those distant obscurely named heights like broken swords the rim of the world a little later you could just see the newly opened quarries like streaks of snow on their russetbrown bosoms thither in springtime all eyes turned from athens devoutly intent till the first shaft of lightning gave signal for the departure of the sacred ship to delos racing over those rocky surfaces the virgin air descended hither with the secret of profound sleep as the child lay in its cubicle hewn in the stone the white fleeces heaped warmly round him in the wild amazons soul to her surprise and at first against her will the maternal sense had quickened from the moment of his conception and kindling more eagerly at every token of manly growth had at length driven out every other feeling and this animal sentiment educating the human hand and heart in her had become a moral one when king theseus leaving her in anger visibly unkind the child had crept to her side and tracing with small fingers the wrinkled lines of her woebegone brow carved there as if by a thousand years of sorrow had sown between himself and her the seed of an undying sympathy she was thus already on the watch for a host of minute recognitions on his part of the selfsacrifice involved in her devotion to a career of which she must needs drain out the sorrow careful that he might taste only the joy so far amid their spare living the child as if looking up to the warm broad wing of her love above him seemed replete with comfort yet in his moments of childish sickness the first passing shadows upon the deep joy of her motherhood she teaches him betimes to soothe or cheat pain little bodily pains only hitherto she ventures sadly to assure him of the harsh necessities of life carefully inverting the habits of her own rude childhood she learned to spin the wools white and grey to clothe and cover him pleasantly the spectacle of his unsuspicious happiness though at present a matter of purely physical conditions awoke a strange sense of poetry a kind of artistic sense in her watching as her own longdeferred recreation in life his delight in the little delicacies she prepared to his likingbroiled kids flesh the red wine the mushrooms sought through the early dewhis hunger and thirst so daintily satisfied as he sat at table like the firstborn of king theseus with two waxlights and a fire at dawn or nightfall dancing to the prattle and laughter a bright child never stupidly weary at times his very happiness would seem to her like a menace of misfortune to come was there not with herself the curse of that unsisterly action and not far from him the terrible danger of the fathers the stepmothers jealousy the mockery of those half brothers to come ah how perilous for happiness the sensibilities which make him so exquisitely happy now before they started on their dreadful visit to the minotaur says plutarch the women told their sons many tales and other things to encourage them and even as she had furnished the child betimes with rules for the solace of bodily pain so now she would have brought her own sad experience into service in precepts for the ejection of its festering power out of any other trouble that might visit him already those little disappointments which are as the shadow beside all conscious enjoyment were no petty things to her but had for her their pathos as childrens troubles will have in spite of the longer chance before them they were as the first steps in a long story of deferred hopes or anticipations of death itself and the end of them the gift of ares gone the mystic girdle she would fain have transferred to the child that bloody god of storm and battle hereditary patron of her house faded from her thoughts together with the memory of her past lifethe more completely because another familiar though somewhat forbidding deity accepting certainly a cruel and forbidding worship was already in possession and reigning in the new home when she came thither only thanks to some kindly local influence artemis this other god she had known in the scythian wilds had put aside her fierce ways as she paused awhile on her heavenly course among these ancient abodes of men gliding softly mainly through their dreams with abundance of salutary touches full in truth of grateful memory of some timely service at human hands in these highland villages the tradition of celestial visitants clung fondly of god or hero belated or misled on long journeys yet pleased to be among the sons of men as their way led them up the steep narrow crooked street condescending to rest a little as one under some sudden stress not clearly ascertained had done here in this very house thereafter for ever sacred the place and its inhabitants of course had been something bigger in the days of those old mythic hospitalities unless indeed divine persons took kindly the will for the deedvery different surely from the present condition of things for there was little here to detain a delicate traveller even in the abode of antiope and her son though it had been the residence of a king hard by stood the chapel of the goddess who had thus adorned the place with her memories the priests indeed were already departed to athens carrying with them the ancient image the vehicle of her actual presence as the surest means of enriching the capital at the expense of the country where she must now make poor shift of the occasional worshipper on his way through these mountain passes but safely roofed beneath the sturdy tiles of grey hymettus marble upon the walls of the little square recess enclosing the deserted pedestal a series of crowded imageries in the devout spirit of earlier days were eloquent concerning her here from scene to scene touched with silver among the wild and human creatures in dun bronze with the moons disk around her head shrouded closely the goddess of the chase still glided mystically through all the varied incidents of her story in all the detail of a written book a book for the delighted reading of a scholar willing to ponder at leisure to make his way surely and understand very different certainly from the cruelfeatured little idol his mother had brought in her bundlethe old scythian artemis hanging there on the wall side by side with the forgotten ares bloodredthe goddess reveals herself to the lad poring through the dusk by taperlight as at once a virgin necessarily therefore the creature of solitude yet also as the assiduous nurse of children and patroness of the young her friendly intervention at the act of birth everywhere her claim upon the nursling among tame and wild creatures equally among men as among gods nay among the stars gave her a breadth of influence seemingly coextensive with the sum of things yes his great mother was in touch with everything yet throughout he can but note her perpetual chastity with pleasurable though halfsuspicious wonder at the mystery he knows not what involved therein as though he awoke suddenly in some distant unexplored region of her person and activity why the lighted torch always and that long straight vesture rolled round so formally was it only against the cold of these northern heights to her nevertheless her maternity her solitude to this virgin mother who with no husband no lover no fruit of her own is so tender to the children of others in a full heart he devotes himself his immaculate body and soul dedicating himself thus he has the sense also that he becomes more entirely than ever the chevalier of his mortal mother of her sad cause the devout diligent hands clear away carefully the dust the faded relics of her former worship a worship renewed once more as the sacred spring set free from encumbrance in answer to his willing ministries murmurs again under the dim vault in its marble basin work of primitive titanic fingersflows out through its rocky channel filling the whole township with chaste thoughts of her through much labour at length he comes to the veritable story of her birth like a gift direct from the goddess herself to this loyal soul there were those in later times who like aeschylus knew artemis as the daughter not of leto but of demeter according to the version of her history now conveyed to the young hippolytus together with some deepened insight into her character the goddess of eleusis on a journey in the old days when as plato says men lived nearer the gods finding herself with child by some starry inmate of those high places had lain down in the rockhewn cubicle of the inner chamber and certainly in sorrow brought forth a daughter here was the secret at once of the genial allembracing maternity of this new strange artemis and of those more dubious tokens the lighted torch the windingsheet the arrow of death on the stringof sudden death truly which may be thought after all the kindest as prevenient of all disgraceful sickness or waste in the unsullied limbs for the late birth into the world of this so shadowy daughter was somehow identified with the sudden passing into hades of her firstborn persephone as he scans those scenes anew an awful surmise comes to him his divine patroness moves there as death surely still however gratefully putting away suspicion he seized even in these ambiguous imageries their happier suggestions satisfied in thinking of his new mother as but the giver of sound sleep of the benign night whencemystery of mysteriesgood things are born softly from which he awakes betimes for his healthful service to her either way sister of apollo or sister of persephone to him she should be a power of sanity sweet as the flowers he offered her gathered at dawn setting daily their purple and white frost against her ancient marbles there was more certainly than the first breath of day in them was there here something of her person her sensible presence by way of direct response to him in his early devotion astir for her sake before the very birds nesting here so freely the quail above all in some privileged connexion with her story still unfathomed by the learned youth amid them he too found a voice and sang articulately the praises of the great goddess those more dubious traits nevertheless so lightly disposed of by hippolytus became to his mother in the light of her sad experience the sum of the whole matter while he drew only peaceful inducements to sleep from that twosided figure she reads there a volume of sinister intentions and liked little this seemingly dead goddess who could but move among the living banefully stealing with her nightshade into the day where she had no proper right the gods had ever had much to do with the shaping of her fortunes and the fortunes of her kindred and the mortal mother felt nothing less than jealousy from the hour when the lad had first delightedly called her to share his discoveries and learn the true story of the new divine mother to whom he has thus absolutely entrusted himself was not this absolute chastity itself a kind of death she too in secret makes her gruesome midnight offering with averted eyes she dreams one night he is in danger creeps to his cubicle to see the face is covered as he lies against the cold she traces the motionless outline raises the coverlet with the nice black head deep in the fleecy pillow he is sleeping quietly he dreams of that other mother gliding in upon the moonbeam and awaking turns sympathetically upon the living woman is subdued in a moment to the expression of her troubled spirit and understands and when the child departed from her for the first time springing from his white bed before the dawn to accompany the elders on their annual visit to the eleusinian goddess the aftersense of his wonderful happiness tranquillising her in spite of herself by its genial power over the actual moment stirred nevertheless a new sort of anxiety for the future her work in life henceforward was defined as a ministry to so precious a gift in full consciousness of its risk it became her religion the centre of her pieties she missed painfully his continual singing hovering about the place like the earth itself made audible in all its humanities halfselfish for a moment she prays that he may remain for ever a child to her solace welcomes now the promise of his chastity as the pledge of his abiding always with her and these thoughts were but infixed more deeply by the sudden stroke of joy at his return home in ceremonial trim and grown more manly with much increase of selfconfidence in that brief absence among his fellows for from the first the unwelcome child the outcast had been successful with that special good fortune which sometimes attends the outcast his happiness his invincible happiness had been found engaging perhaps by the gods certainly by men and when king theseus came to take note how things went in that rough life he had assigned them he felt a half liking for the boy and bade him come down to athens and see the sights partly by way of proof to his already somewhat exacting wife of the difference between the old love and the new as measured by the present condition of their respective offspring the fine nature fastidious by instinct but bred with frugality enough to find the charm of continual surprise in that delicate new athens draws as he goes the full savour of its novelties the marbles the space and finish the busy gaiety of its streets the elegance of life there contrasting with while it adds some mysterious endearment to the thought of his own rude home without envy in hope only one day to share to win them by kindness he gazes on the motley gardenplots the soft bedding the showy toys the delicate keep of the children of phaedra who turn curiously to their halfbrother venture to touch his long strange gown of homespun grey like the soft coat of some wild creature who might let one stroke it close to their dainty existence for a while he regards it as from afar looks forward all day to the lights the prattle the laughter the white bread like sweet cake to him of their ordinary evening meal returns again and again in spite of himself to watch to admire feeling a power within him to merit the like finds his way back at last still light of heart to his own poor fare able to do without what he would enjoy so much as grateful for his scanty part in thingsfor the makebelieve of a feast in the little white loaves she too has managed to come by sipping the thin white wine he touches her dearly the mother is shocked with a sense of something unearthly in his contentment while he comes and goes singing now more abundantly than ever a new canticle to her divine rival were things after all to go grudgingly with him sensible of that curse on herself with her suspicions of his kinsfolk of this dubious goddess to whom he has devoted himself she anticipates with more foreboding than ever his path to be with or without a wifeher own solitude or histhe painful heats and cold she fears even these late successes it were best to veil their heads the strong as such had ever been against her and hers the father came again noted the boys growth manliest of men like hercules in his cloak of lions skin he has after all but scant liking feels through a certain meanness of soul scorn for the finer likeness of himself might this creature of an already vanishing world who for all his hard rearing had a manifest distinction of character one day become his rival full of loyalty as he was already to the deserted mother to charming athens nevertheless he crept back as occasion served to gaze peacefully on the delightful good fortune of others waiting for the opportunity to take his own turn with the rest driving down thither at last in a chariot gallantly when all the town was assembled to celebrate the kings birthday for the goddess herself turning ever kinder and figuring more and more exclusively as the tender nurse of all things had transformed her young votary from a hunter into a charioteer a rearer and driver of horses after the fashion of his amazon mothers before him thereupon all the lads wholesome vanity had centered on the fancy of the worldfamous games then lately established as smiling down his mothers terrors and grateful to his celestial mother for many a hairbreadth escape he practised day by day fed the animals drove them out amused though companionless visited them affectionately in the deserted stone stables of the ancient king a chariot and horses as being the showiest outward thing the world afforded was like the pawn he moved to represent the big demand he meant to make honestly generously on the ample fortunes of life there was something of his old miraculous kindred alien from this busy new world he came to about the boyish driver with the fame of a scholar in his grey fleecy cloak and hood of soft white woollen stuff as he drove in that morning men seemed to have seen a star flashing and crowded round to examine the little mountainbred beasts in loud friendly intercourse with the hero of the houreven those usually somewhat unsympathetic halfbrothers now full of enthusiasm for the outcast and his good fight for prosperity instinctively people admired his wonderful placidity and would fain have shared its secret as it were the carelessness of some fair flower upon his face a victor in the days race he carried home as his prize a glittering new harness in place of the very old one he had come with he says now with his single touch of pride yet at home savouring to the full his old solitary happiness veiled again from time to time in that ancient life he is still the student still ponders the old writings which tell of his divine patroness at athens strange stories are told in turn of him his nights upon the mountains his dreamy sin with that hypocritical virgin goddess stories which set the jealous suspicions of theseus at rest once more for so not those who have the tangible appraisable world in view even queen phaedra looks with pleasure as he comes on the once despised illegitimate creature at home now here too singing always audaciously so visibly happy occupied popular encompassed by the luxuries of athens far from those peaceful mountain places among people further still in spirit from their peaceful light and shade he did not forget the kindly goddess still sharing with his earthly mother the prizes or what they would buy for the adornment of their spare abode the tombs of the fallen amazons the spot where they had breathed their last he piously visited informed himself of every circumstance of the event with devout care and thinking on them amid the dainties of the royal table boldly brought them too their share of the offerings to the heroic dead aphrodite indeedaphrodite of whom he had scarcely so much as heardwas just then the bestserved deity in athens with all its new wealth of colour and form its gold and ivory the acting the music the fantastic women beneath the shadow of the great walls still rising steadily hippolytus would have no part in her worship instead did what was in him to revive the neglected service of his own goddess stirring an old jealousy for aphrodite too had looked with delight upon the youth already the centre of a hundred less dangerous human rivalries among the maidens of greece and was by no means indifferent to his indifference his instinctive distaste while the sterner almost forgotten artemis found once more her great moonshaped cake set about with starry tapers at the appointed seasons they know him now from afar by his emphatic shooting arrowy movements and on the day of the great chariot races to the surprise of all he compounded his handsome prize for the old wooden image taken from the chapel at home lurking now in an obscure shrine in the meanest quarter of the town sober amid the noisy feasting which followed unashamed but travelling by night to hide it from their mockery warm at his bosom he reached the passes at twilight and through the deep peace of the glens bore it to the old restingplace now more worthy than ever of the presence of its mistress his mother and all the people of the village coming forth to salute her all doors set mystically open as she advances phaedra too his stepmother a fiery soul with wild strange blood in her veins forgetting her fears of this illegitimate rival of her children seemed now to have seen him for the first time loved at last the very touch of his fleecy cloak and would fain have had him of her own religion as though the once neglected child had been another she tries to win him as a stranger in his manly perfection growing more than an affectionate mother to her husbands son but why thus intimate and congenial she asks always in the wrong quarter why not compass two ends at once why so squeamishly neglect the powerful any power at all in a city so full of religion he might find the image of her sprightly goddess everywhere to his liking gold silver native or stranger new or old graceful or indeed if he preferred it so in iron or stone by the way she explains the delights of love of marriage the husband once out of the way finds in him with misgiving a sort of forwardness as she thinks on this one matter as if he understood her craft and despised it he met her questions in truth with scarce so much as contempt with laughing counterqueries why people needed wedding at all they might have found the children in the temples or bought them as you could buy flowers in athens meantime phaedras young children draw from the seemingly unconscious finger the marriagering set it spinning on the floor at his feet and the staid youth places it for a moment on his own finger for safety as it settles there his stepmother aware all the while suddenly presses his hand over it he found the ring there that night as he lay left his bed in the darkness and again for safety put it on the finger of the image wedding once for all that so kindly mystical mother and still even amid his earthly mothers terrible misgivings he seems to foresee a charming career marked out before him in friendly athens to the height of his desire grateful that he is here at all sharing at last so freely lifes banquet he puts himself for a moment in his old place recalling his old enjoyment of the pleasure of others feels just then no different yet never had life seemed so sufficing as at this moment the meat the drink the drives the popularity as he comes and goes even his stepmothers false selfish ostentatious gifts but she too begins to feel something of the jealousy of that other divine wouldbe mistress and by way of a last effort to bring him to a better mind in regard to them both conducts him to her own private chapel you could hardly tell where the apartments of the adulteress ended and that of the divine courtesan began haunts of her long indolent selfpleasing nights and days they presented everywhere the impress of phaedras luxurious humour a peculiar glow such as he had never before seen like heady lamplight or sunshine to some sleeper in a delirious dream hung upon clung to the bold naked shameful imageries as his stepmother trimmed the lamps drew forth her sickly perfumes clad afresh in piquant change of raiment the almost formless goddess crouching there in her unclean shrine or stye set at last her foolish wheel in motion to a low chant holding him by the wrist keeping close all the while as if to catch some germ of consent in his indifferent words and little by little he perceives that all this is for himthe incense the dizzy wheel the shreds of stuff cut secretly from his sleeve the sweetened cup he drank at her offer unavailingly and yes his own features surely in pallid wax with a gasp of flighty laughter she ventures to point the thing out to him full as he is at last of visible irrepressible dislike ah it was that very reluctance that chiefly stirred her healthily white and red he had a marvellous air of discretion about him as of one never to be caught unaware as if he never could be anything but like water from the rock or the wild flowers of the morning or the beams of the morning star turned to human flesh it was the selfpossession of this happy mind the purity of this virgin body she would fain have perturbed as a pledge to herself of her own gaudy claim to supremacy king theseus as she knew had had at least two earlier loves for once she would be a first love felt at moments that with this one passion once indulged it might be happiness thereafter to remain chaste for ever and then by accident yet surely reading indifference in his manner of accepting her gifts she is ready again for contemptuous open battle is he indeed but a child still this nursling of the forbidding amazon of that amazonian goddessto be a child always or a wily priest rather skilfully circumventing her sorceries with mystic precautions of his own in truth there is something of the priestly character in this impassible discretion reminding her of his alleged intimacy with the rival goddess and redoubling her curiosity her fondness phaedra lovesick feverish in bodily sickness at last raves of the cool woods the chase the steeds of hippolytus her thoughts running madly on what she fancies to be his secret business with a storm of abject tears foreseeing in one moment of recoil the weary tale of years to come starstricken as she declares she dared at last to confess her longing to already halfsuspicious attendants and awake one morning to find hippolytus there kindly at her bidding drove him openly forth in a tempest of insulting speech there was a mordant there like the menace of misfortune to come in which the injured goddess also was invited to concur what words what terrible words following clinging to him like acrid fire upon his bare flesh as he hasted from phaedras house thrust out at last his vesture remaining in her hands the husband returning suddenly she tells him a false story of violence to her bed and is believed king theseus all his accumulated store of suspicion and dislike turning now to active hatred flung away readily upon him bewildered unheard one of three precious curses with which poseidon had indulged him it seemed sad that one so young must call for justice precariously upon the gods the dead the very walls admiring youth dared hardly bid farewell to their late comrade are generous at most in stolen sympathetic glances towards the fallen star at home veiled once again in that ancient twilight world his mother fearing solely for what he may suffer by the departure of that so brief prosperity enlarged as it had been even so by his grateful taking of it is reassured delighted happy once more at the visible proof of his happiness his invincible happiness duly he returned to athens early astir for the last time to restore the forfeited gifts drove back his gaily painted chariot to leave there behind him actually enjoying the drive going home on foot poorer than ever he takes again to his former modes of life a little less to the horses a little more to the old studies the strange secret history of his favourite goddesswronged surely somehow she too as powerless to help him till he lay sick at last battling one morning unaware of his mothers presence with the feverish creations of the brain the giddy foolish wheel the foolish song of phaedras chapel spinning there with his heart bound thereto he cries his wholesome religion seeming to turn against him now the trees the streams the very rocks swoon into living creatures swarming around the goddess who has lost her grave quietness he finds solicitation and recoils in the wind in the sounds of the rain till at length delirium itself finds a note of returning health the feverish woodways of his fancy open unexpectedly upon wide currents of air lulling him to sleep and the conflict ending suddenly altogether at its sharpest he lay in the early light motionless among the pillows his mother standing by as she thought to see him die as if for the last time she presses on him the things he had liked best in that eating and drinking she had found so beautiful the eyes the eyelids are big with sorrow and as he understands again making an effort for her sake the healthy light returns into his a hand seizes hers gratefully and a slow convalescence begins the happiest period in the wild mothers life when he longed for flowers for the goddess she went a toilsome journey to seek them growing close after long neglect wholesome and firm on their tall stalks the singing she had longed for so despairingly hovers gaily once more within the chapel and around the house at the crisis of that strange illness she had supposed her long forebodings about to be realised at last but upon his recovery feared no more assured herself that the curses of the father the stepmother the concurrent illwill of that angry goddess have done their utmost he will outlive her a few years hence put her to a rest surely welcome her misgivings arising always out of the actual spectacle of his profound happiness seemed at an end in this meek bliss the more as she observed that it was a shade less unconscious than of old and almost suddenly he found the strength the heart in him to try his fortune again with the old chariot and those still unsatisfied curses in truth going on either side of him like living creatures unseen legend tells briefly how a competitor for pity with adonis and icarus and hyacinth and other doomed creatures of immature radiance in all story to come he set forth joyously for the chariotraces not of athens but of troezen her rival once more he wins the prize he says goodbye to admiring friends anxious to entertain him and by night starts off homewards as of old like a child returning quickly through the solitude in which he had never lacked company and was now to die through all the perils of darkness he had guided the chariot safely along the curved shore the dawn was come and a little breeze astir as the grey level spaces parted delicately into white and blue when in a moment an earthquake or poseidon the earthshaker himself or angry aphrodite awake from the deep betimes rent the tranquil surface a great wave leapt suddenly into the placid distance of the attic shore and was surging here to the very necks of the plunging horses a moment since enjoying so pleasantly with him the caress of the morning air but now wholly forgetful of their old affectionate habit of obedience dragging their leader headlong over the rough pavements evening and the dawn might seem to have met on that hapless day through which they drew him home entangled in the trappings of the chariot that had been his ruin till he lay at length grey and haggard at the rest he had longed for dimly amid the buffeting of those murderous stones his mother watching impassibly sunk at once into the condition she had so long anticipated later legend breaks a supernatural light over that great desolation and would fain relieve the reader by introducing the kindly asclepius who presently restores the youth to life not however in the old form or under familiar conditions to her surely counting the wounds the disfigurements telling over the pains which had shot through that dear head now insensible to her touch among the pillows under the harsh broad daylight that would have been no more of a solace than if according to the fancy of ovid he flourished still a little deity but under a new name and veiled now in old age in the haunted grove of aricia far from his old attic home in a land which had never seen him as he was the beginnings of greek sculpture i the heroic age of greek art the extant remains of greek sculpture though but a fragment of what the greek sculptors produced are both in number and in excellence in their fitness therefore to represent the whole of which they were a part quite out of proportion to what has come down to us of greek painting and all those minor crafts which in the greek workshop as at all periods when the arts have been really vigorous were closely connected with the highest imaginative work greek painting is represented to us only by its distant reflexion on the walls of the buried houses of pompeii and the designs of subordinate though exquisite craftsmen on the vases of wrought metal partly through the inherent usefulness of its material tempting ignorant persons into whose hands it may fall to refashion it we have comparatively little while in consequence of the perishableness of their material nothing remains of the curious woodwork the carved ivory the embroidery and coloured stuffs on which the greeks set much storeof that whole system of refined artisanship diffused like a general atmosphere of beauty and richness around the more exalted creations of greek sculpture what we possess then of that highest greek sculpture is presented to us in a sort of threefold isolation isolation first of all from the concomitant artsthe frieze of the parthenon without the metal bridles on the horses for which the holes in the marble remain isolation secondly from the architectural group of which with most careful estimate of distance and point of observation that frieze for instance was designed to be a part isolation thirdly from the clear greek skies the poetical greek life in our modern galleries and if one here or there in looking at these things bethinks himself of the required substitution if he endeavours mentally to throw them back into that proper atmosphere through which alone they can exercise over us all the magic by which they charmed their original spectators the effort is not always a successful one within the grey walls of the louvre or the british museum and the circumstance that greek sculpture is presented to us in such falsifying isolation from the work of the weaver the carpenter and the goldsmith has encouraged a manner of regarding it too little sensuous approaching it with full information concerning what may be called the inner life of the greeks their modes of thought and sentiment amply recorded in the writings of the greek poets and philosophers but with no lively impressions of that mere craftsmans world of which so little has remained students of antiquity have for the most part interpreted the creations of greek sculpture rather as elements in a sequence of abstract ideas as embodiments in a sort of petrified language of pure thoughts and as interesting mainly in connexion with the development of greek intellect than as elements of a sequence in the material order as results of a designed and skilful dealing of accomplished fingers with precious forms of matter for the delight of the eyes greek sculpture has come to be regarded as the product of a peculiarly limited art dealing with a specially abstracted range of subjects and the greek sculptor as a workman almost exclusively intellectual having only a sort of accidental connexion with the material in which his thought was expressed he is fancied to have been disdainful of such matters as the mere tone the fibre or texture of his marble or cedarwood of that just perceptible yellowness for instance in the ivorylike surface of the venus of melos as being occupied only with forms as abstract almost as the conceptions of philosophy and translateable it might be supposed into any materiala habit of regarding him still further encouraged by the modern sculptors usage of employing merely mechanical labour in the actual working of the stone the works of the highest greek sculpture are indeed intellectualised if we may say so to the utmost degree the human figures which they present to us seem actually to conceive thoughts in them that profoundly reasonable spirit of design which is traceable in greek art continuously and increasingly upwards from its simplest products the oilvessel or the urn reaches its perfection yet though the most abstract and intellectualised of sensuous objects they are still sensuous and material addressing themselves in the first instance not to the purely reflective faculty but to the eye and a complete criticism must have approached them from both sides from the side of the intelligence indeed towards which they rank as great thoughts come down into the stone but from the sensuous side also towards which they rank as the most perfect results of that pure skill of hand of which the venus of melos we may say is the highest example and the little polished pitcher or lamp also perfect in its way perhaps the lowest to pass by the purely visible side of these things then is not only to miss a refining pleasure but to mistake altogether the medium in which the most intellectual of the creations of greek art the aeginetan or the elgin marbles for instance were actually produced even these having in their origin depended for much of their charm on the mere material in which they were executed and the whole black and grey world of extant antique sculpture needing to be translated back into ivory and gold if we would feel the excitement which the greek seems to have felt in the presence of these objects to have this really greek sense of greek sculpture it is necessary to connect it indeed with the inner life of the greek world its thought and sentiment on the one hand but on the other hand to connect it also with the minor works of price intaglios coins vases with that whole system of material refinement and beauty in the outer greek life which these minor works represent to us and it is with these as far as possible that we must seek to relieve the air of our galleries and museums of their too intellectual greyness greek sculpture could not have been precisely a cold thing and whatever a colourblind school may say pure thoughts have their coldness a coldness which has sometimes repelled from greek sculpture with its unsuspected fund of passion and energy in material form those who cared much and with much insight for a similar passion and energy in the coloured world of italian painting theoretically then we need that world of the minor arts as a complementary background for the higher and more austere greek sculpture and as matter of fact it is just with such a worldwith a period of refined and exquisite tectonics that greek art actually begins in what is called the heroic age that earliest undefined period of greek civilisation the beginning of which cannot be dated and which reaches down to the first olympiad about the year bc of this period we possess indeed no direct history and but few actual monuments great or small but as to its whole character and outward local colouring for its art as for its politics and religion homer may be regarded as an authority the iliad and the odyssey the earliest pictures of that heroic life represent it as already delighting itself in the application of precious material and skilful handiwork to personal and domestic adornment to the refining and beautifying of the entire outward aspect of life above all in the lavish application of very graceful metalwork to such purposes and this representation is borne out by what little we possess of its actual remains and by all we can infer mixed of course with mere fable as a description of the heroic age the picture which homer presents to us deprived of its supernatural adjuncts becomes continuously more and more realisable as the actual condition of early art when we emerge gradually into historical time and find ourselves at last among dateable works and real schools or masters the history of greek art then begins as some have fancied general history to begin in a golden age but in an age so to speak of real gold the period of those first twisters and hammerers of the precious metalsmen who had already discovered the flexibility of silver and the ductility of gold the capacity of both for infinite delicacy of handling and who enjoyed with complete freshness a sense of beauty and fitness in their worka period of which that flower of gold on a silver stalk picked up lately in one of the graves at mycenae or the legendary golden honeycomb of daedalus might serve as the symbol the heroic age of greek art is the age of the hero as smith there are in homer two famous descriptive passages in which this delight in curious metalwork is very prominent the description in the iliad of the shield of achilles and the description of the house of alcinous in the odyssey the shield of achilles is part of the suit of armour which hephaestus makes for him at the request of thetis and it is wrought of variously coloured metals woven into a great circular composition in relief representing the world and the life in it the various activities of man are recorded in this description in a series of idyllic incidents with such complete freshness liveliness and variety that the reader from time to time may well forget himself and fancy he is reading a mere description of the incidents of actual life we peep into a little greek town and see in dainty miniature the bride coming from her chamber with torchbearers and dancers the people gazing from their doors a quarrel between two persons in the marketplace the assembly of the elders to decide upon it in another quartering is the spectacle of a city besieged the walls defended by the old men while the soldiers have stolen out and are lying in ambush there is a fight on the riverbank ares and athene conspicuous in gold and marked as divine persons by a scale larger than that of their followers lead the host the strange mythical images of kêr eris and kudoimos mingle in the crowd a third space upon the shield depicts the incidents of peaceful labourthe ploughshare passing through the field of enameled black metal behind it and golden before the cup of mead held out to the ploughman when he reaches the end of the furrow the reapers with their sheaves the king standing in silent pleasure among them intent upon his staff there are the labourers in the vineyard in minutest detail stakes of silver on which the vines hang the dark trench about it and one pathway through the midst the whole complete and distinct in variously coloured metal all things and living creatures are in their placesthe cattle coming to water to the sound of the herdsmans pipe various music the rushes by the waterside a lionhunt with dogs the pastures among the hills a dance the fair dresses of the male and female dancers the former adorned with swords the latter with crowns it is an image of ancient life its pleasure and business for the centre as in some quaint chart of the heavens are the earth and the sun the moon and constellations and to close in all right round like a frame to the picture the great river oceanus forming the rim of the shield in some metal of dark blue still more fascinating perhaps because more completely realisable by the fancy as an actual thingrealisable as a delightful place to pass time inis the description of the palace of alcinous in the little island town of the phaeacians to which we are introduced in all the liveliness and sparkle of the morning as real as something seen last summer on the seacoast although appropriately ulysses meets a goddess like a young girl carrying a pitcher on his way up from the sea below the steep walls of the town two projecting jetties allow a narrow passage into a haven of stone for the ships into which the passerby may look down as they lie moored below the roadway in the midst is the kings house all glittering again with curiously wrought metal its brightness is the heart of ulysses beats quickly when he sees it standing amid plantations ingeniously watered its floor and walls of brass throughout with continuous cornice of dark iron the doors are of gold the doorposts and lintels of silver the handles again of gold the walls were massy brass the cornice high blue metals crowned in colours of the sky rich plates of gold the foldingdoors incase the pillars silver on a brazen base silver the lintels deepprojecting oer and gold the ringlets that command the door dogs of the same precious metals keep watch on either side like the lions over the old gateway of mycenae or the gigantic humanheaded bulls at the entrance of an assyrian palace within doors the burning lights at suppertime are supported in the hands of golden images of boys while the guests recline on a couch running all along the wall covered with peculiarly sumptuous womens work from these two glittering descriptions manifestly something must be deducted we are in wonderland and among supernatural or magical conditions but the forging of the shield and the wonderful house of alcinous are no merely incongruous episodes in homer but the consummation of what is always characteristic of him a constant preoccupation namely with every form of lovely craftsmanship resting on all things as he says like the shining of the sun we seem to pass in reading him through the treasures of some royal collection in him the presentation of almost every aspect of life is beautified by the work of cunning hands the thrones coffers couches of curious carpentry are studded with bossy ornaments of precious metal effectively disposed or inlaid with stained ivory or blue cyanus or amber or pale amberlike gold the surfaces of the stone conduits the seawalls the public washingtroughs the ramparts on which the weary soldiers rest themselves when returned to troy are fair and smooth all the fine qualities in colour and texture of woven stuff are carefully notedthe fineness closeness softness pliancy gloss the whiteness or nectarlike tints in which the weaver delights to work to weave the seapurple threads is the appropriate function of queens and noble women all the homeric shields are more or less ornamented with variously coloured metal terrible sometimes like leonardos with some monster or grotesque the numerous sorts of cups are bossed with golden studs or have handles wrought with figures of doves for instance the great brazen cauldrons bear an epithet which means flowery the trappings of the horses the various parts of the chariots are formed of various metals the womens ornaments and the instruments of their toilet are described porpas te gnamptas th helikas kalukas te kai hormous the golden vials for unguents use and beauty are still undivided all that mens hands are set to make has still a fascination alike for workmen and spectators for such dainty splendour troy indeed is especially conspicuous but then homers trojans are essentially greeksgreeks of asia and troy though more advanced in all elements of civilisation is no real contrast to the western shore of the aegean it is no barbaric world that we see but the sort of world we may think that would have charmed also our comparatively jaded sensibilities with just that quaint simplicity which we too enjoy in its productions above all in its wrought metal which loses perhaps more than any other sort of work by becoming mechanical the metalwork which homer describes in such variety is all hammerwork all the joinings being effected by pins or riveting that is just the sort of metalwork which in a certain naïveté and vigour is still of all work the most expressive of actual contact with dexterous fingers one seems to trace in it on every particle of the partially resisting material the touch and play of the shaping instruments in highly trained hands under the guidance of exquisitely disciplined sensesthat cachet or seal of nearness to the workmans hand which is the special charm of all good metalwork of early metalwork in particular such descriptions however it may be said are mere poetical ornament of no value in helping us to define the character of an age but what is peculiar in these homeric descriptions what distinguishes them from others at first sight similar is a sort of internal evidence they present of a certain degree of reality signs in them of an imagination stirred by surprise at the spectacle of real works of art such minute delighted loving description of details of ornament such following out of the ways in which brass gold silver or paler gold go into the chariots and armour and womens dress or cling to the wallsthe enthusiasm of the manner is the warrant of a certain amount of truth in all that the greek poet describes these things with the same vividness and freshness the same kind of fondness with which other poets speak of flowers speaking of them poetically indeed but with that higher sort of poetry which seems full of the lively impression of delightful things recently seen genuine poetry it is true is always naturally sympathetic with all beautiful sensible things and qualities but with how many poets would not this constant intrusion of material ornament have produced a tawdry effect the metal would all be tarnished and the edges blurred and this is because it is not always that the products of even exquisite tectonics can excite or refine the aesthetic sense now it is probable that the objects of oriental art the imitations of it at home in which for homer this actual world of art must have consisted reached him in a quantity and with a novelty just sufficient to warm and stimulate without surfeiting the imagination it is an exotic thing of which he sees just enough and not too much the shield of achilles the house of alcinous are like dreams indeed but this sort of dreaming winds continuously through the entire iliad and odysseya childs dream after a day of real fresh impressions from things themselves in which all those floating impressions reset themselves he is as pleased in touching and looking at those objects as his own heroes their gleaming aspect brightens all he says and has taken hold one might think of his language his very vocabulary becoming chryselephantine homers artistic descriptions though enlarged by fancy are not wholly imaginary and the extant remains of monuments of the earliest historical age are like lingering relics of that dream in a tamer but real world the art of the heroic age then as represented in homer connects itself on the one side with those fabulous jewels so prominent in mythological story and entwined sometimes so oddly in its representation of human fortunesthe necklace of eriphyle the necklace of helen which menelaus it was said offered at delphi to athene pronoea on the eve of his expedition against troymythical objects indeed but which yet bear witness even thus early to the aesthetic susceptibility of the greek temper but on the other hand the art of the heroic age connects itself also with the actual early beginnings of artistic production there are touches of reality for instance in homers incidental notices of its instruments and processes especially as regards the working of metal he goes already to the potters wheel for familiar lifelike illustration in describing artistic woodwork he distinguishes various stages of work we see clearly the instruments for turning and boring such as the oldfashioned drillborer whirled round with a string he mentions the names of two artists the one of an actual workman the other of a craft turned into a proper namestray relics accidentally preserved of a world as we may believe of such wide and varied activity the forge of hephaestus is a true forge the magic tripods on which he is at work are really put together by conceivable processes known in early times compositions in relief similar to those which he describes were actually made out of thin metal plates cut into a convenient shape and then beaten into the designed form by the hammer over a wooden model these reliefs were then fastened to a differently coloured metal background or base with nails or rivets for there is no soldering of metals as yet to this process the ancients gave the name of empaestik such embossing being still in our own time a beautiful form of metalwork even in the marvellous shield there are other and indirect notes of reality in speaking of the shield of achilles i departed intentionally from the order in which the subjects of the relief are actually introduced in the iliad because just then i wished the reader to receive the full effect of the variety and elaborateness of the composition as a representation or picture of the whole of ancient life embraced within the circumference of a shield but in the order in which homer actually describes those episodes he is following the method of a very practicable form of composition and is throughout much closer than we might at first sight suppose to the ancient armourers proceedings the shield is formed of five superimposed plates of different metals each plate of smaller diameter than the one immediately below it their flat margins showing thus as four concentric stripes or rings of metal around a sort of boss in the centre five metals thick and the outermost circle or ring being the thinnest to this arrangement the order of homers description corresponds the earth and the heavenly bodies are upon this boss in the centre like a little distant heaven hung above the broad world and from this homer works out round and round to the river oceanus which forms the border of the whole the subjects answering to or supporting each other in a sort of heraldic orderthe city at peace set over against the city besieged spring summer and autumn balancing each otherquite congruously with a certain heraldic turn common in contemporary assyrian art which delights in this sort of conventional spacing out of its various subjects and especially with some extant metal chargers of assyrian work which like some of the earliest greek vases with their painted plants and flowers conventionally arranged illustrate in their humble measure such heraldic grouping the description of the shield of hercules attributed to hesiod is probably an imitation of homer and notwithstanding some fine mythological impersonations which it contains an imitation less admirable than the original of painting there are in homer no certain indications and it is consistent with the later date of the imitator that we may perhaps discern in his composition a sign that what he had actually seen was a painted shield in the predominance in it as compared with the homeric description of effects of colour over effects of form homer delighting in ingenious devices for fastening the metal and the supposed hesiod rather in what seem like triumphs of heraldic colouring though the latter also delights in effects of mingled metals of mingled gold and silver especially silver figures with dresses of gold silver centaurs with pinetrees of gold for staves in their hands still like the shield of achilles this too we must conceive as formed of concentric plates of metal and here again that spacing is still more elaborately carried out narrower intermediate rings being apparently introduced between the broader ones with figures in rapid horizontal unbroken motion carrying the eye right round the shield in contrast with the repose of the downward or inward movement of the subjects which divide the larger spaces here too with certain analogies in the rows of animals to the designs on the earliest vases in hesiod then as in homer there are undesigned notes of correspondence between the partly mythical ornaments imaginatively enlarged of the heroic age and a world of actual handicrafts in the shield of hercules another marvellous detail is added in the image of perseus very daintily described as hovering in some wonderful way as if really borne up by wings above the surface and that curious haunting sense of magic in art which comes out over and over again in homerin the golden maids for instance who assist hephaestus in his work and similar details which seem at first sight to destroy the credibility of the whole picture and make of it a mere wonderlandis itself also rightly understood a testimony to a real excellence in the art of homers time it is sometimes said that works of art held to be miraculous are always of an inferior kind but at least it was not among those who thought them inferior that the belief in their miraculous power began if the golden images move like living creatures and the armour of achilles so wonderfully made lifts him like wings this again is because the imagination of homer is really under the stimulus of delightful artistic objects actually seen only those to whom such artistic objects manifest themselves through real and powerful impressions of their wonderful qualities can invest them with properties magical or miraculous i said that the inherent usefulness of the material of metalwork makes the destruction of its acquired form almost certain if it comes into the possession of people either barbarous or careless of the work of a past time greek art is for us in all its stages a fragment only in each of them it is necessary in a somewhat visionary manner to fill up empty spaces and more or less make substitution and of the finer work of the heroic age thus dimly discerned as an actual thing we had at least till recently almost nothing two plates of bronze a few rusty nails and certain rows of holes in the inner surface of the walls of the of mycenae were the sole representatives of that favourite device of primitive greek art the lining of stone walls with burnished metal of which the house of alcinous in the odyssey is the ideal picture and the temple of pallas of the brazen house at sparta adorned in the interior with a coating of reliefs in metal a later historical example of the heroic or socalled cyclopean architecture that a building so imposing that pausanias thought it worthy to rank with the pyramids is a sufficient illustration treasury or tomb or both this domeshaped building formed of concentric rings of stones gradually diminishing to a copingstone at the top may stand as the representative of some similar buildings in other parts of greece and of many others in a similar kind of architecture elsewhere constructed of large manysided blocks of stone fitted carefully together without the aid of cement and remaining in their places by reciprocal resistance characteristic of it is the general tendency to use vast blocks of stone for the jambs and lintels of doors for instance and in the construction of gableshaped passages two rows of such stones being made to rest against each other at an acute angle within the thickness of the walls so vast and rude fretted by the action of nearly three thousand years the fragments of this architecture may often seem at first sight like works of nature at argos tiryns mycenae the skeleton of the old architecture is more complete at mycenae the gateway of the acropolis is still standing with its two wellknown sculptured lionsimmemorial and almost unique monument of primitive greek sculpturesupporting heraldwise a symbolical pillar on the vast triangular pedimental stone above the heads are gone having been fashioned possibly in metal by workmen from the east on what may be called the façade remains are still discernible of inlaid work in coloured stone and within the gateway on the smooth slabs of the pavement the wheelruts are still visible connect them with those metal warchariots in homer and you may see in fancy the whole grandiose character of the place as it may really have been shut within the narrow enclosure of these shadowy citadels were the palaces of the kings with all that intimacy which we may sometimes suppose to have been alien from the openair greek life admitting doubtless below the cover of their rough walls many of those refinements of princely life which the middle age found possible in such places and of which the impression is so fascinating in homers description for instance of the house of ulysses or of menelaus at sparta rough and frowning without these old châteaux of the argive kings were delicate within with a decoration almost as dainty and fine as the network of weed and flower that now covers their ruins and of the delicacy of which as i said that golden flower on its silver stalk or the golden honeycomb of daedalus might be taken as representative in these metallike structures of selfsupporting polygons locked so firmly and impenetrably together with the whole mystery of the reasonableness of the arch implicitly within them there is evidence of a complete artistic command over weight in stone and an understanding of the but over weight only the ornament still seems to be not strictly architectural but according to the notices of homer tectonic borrowed from the sister arts above all from the art of the metalworkers to whom those spaces of the building are left which a later age fills with painting or relief in stone the skill of the asiatic comes to adorn this rough native building and it is a late elaborate somewhat voluptuous skill we may understand illustrated by the luxury of that asiatic chamber of paris less like that of a warrior than of one going to the dance coupled with the vastness of the architectural works which actually remain such descriptions as that in homer of the chamber of paris and the house of alcinous furnish forth a picture of that early periodthe tyrants age the age of the acropoleis the period of great dynasties with claims to and in many instances at least with all the culture of their time the vast buildings make us sigh at the thought of wasted human labour though there is a public usefulness too in some of these designs such as the draining of the copaic lake to which the backs of the people are bent whether they will or not for the princes there is much of that selfish personal luxury which is a constant trait of feudalism in all ages for the people scattered over the country at their agricultural labour or gathered in small hamlets there is some enjoyment perhaps of the aspect of that splendour of the bright warriors on the heightsa certain share of the nobler pride of the tyrants themselves in those tombs and dwellings some surmise also there seems to have been of the of gold with a dim lurking suspicion of curious facilities for cruelty in the command over those skilful artificers in metal some ingenious rack or bull the tradition of which not unlike the modern jacques bonhommes shudder at the old ruined french donjon or bastille haunts generations afterwards the ruins of those of stone where the old tyrants had their pleasures for it is a mistake to suppose that that wistful sense of eeriness in ruined buildings to which most of us are susceptible is an exclusively modern feeling the name cyclopean attached to those desolate remains of buildings which were older than greek history itself attests their romantic influence over the fancy of the people who thus attributed them to a superhuman strength and skill and the cyclopes like all the early mythical names of artists have this note of reality that they are names not of individuals but of classes the guilds or companies of workmen in which a certain craft was imparted and transmitted the dactyli the fingers are the first workers in iron the savage chalybes in scythia the first smelters actual names are given to the old fabled telchines chalkon argyron chrysonworkers in brass silver and gold respectively the tradition of their activity haunts the several regions where those metals were found they make the trident of poseidon but then poseidons trident is a real fishermans instrument the tunnyfork they are credited notwithstanding with an evil sorcery unfriendly to men as poor humanity remembered the makers of chains locks procrustean beds and as becomes this dark recondite mine and metal work the traditions about them are gloomy and grotesque confusing mortal workmen with demon guilds to this view of the heroic age of greek art as being so to speak an age of real gold an age delighting itself in precious material and exquisite handiwork in all tectonic crafts the recent extraordinary discoveries at troy and mycenae are on any plausible theory of their date and origin a witness the aesthetic critic needs always to be on his guard against the confusion of mere curiosity or antiquity with beauty in art among the objects discovered at troymere curiosities some of them however interesting and instructivethe socalled royal cup of priam in solid gold twohandled and double lipped has in the very simplicity of its design the grace of the economy with which it exactly fulfils its purpose a positive beauty an absolute value for the aesthetic sense while strange and new enough if it really settles at last a muchdebated expression of homer while the with its twisted chains and flowers of pale gold shows that those profuse golden fringes waving so comely as he moved which hephaestus wrought for the helmet of achilles were really within the compass of early greek art and the story of the excavations at mycenae reads more like some welldevised chapter of fiction than a record of sober facts here those sanguine halfchildish dreams of buried treasure discovered in dead mens graves which seem to have a charm for every one are more than fulfilled in the spectacle of those antique kings lying in the splendour of their crowns and breastplates of embossed plate of gold their swords studded with golden imagery at their sides as in some feudal monument their very faces covered up most strangely in golden masks the very floor of one tomb we read was thick with gold dustthe heavy gilding fallen from some perished kingly vestment in another was a downfall of golden leaves and flowers and amid this profusion of thin fine fragments were rings bracelets smaller crowns as if for children dainty butterflies for ornaments of dresses and that golden flower on a silver stalkall of pure soft gold unhardened by alloy the delicate films of which one must touch but lightly yet twisted and beaten by hand and hammer into wavy spiral relief the cuttlefish with its long undulating arms appearing frequently it is the very image of the old luxurious life of the princes of the heroic age as homer describes it with the arts in service to its kingly pride among the other costly objects was one representing the head of a cow grandly designed in gold with horns of silver like the horns of the moon supposed to be symbolical of here the great object of worship at argos one of the interests of the study of mythology is that it reflects the ways of life and thought of the people who conceived it and this religion of here the special religion of argos is congruous with what has been here said as to the place of art in the civilisation of the argives it is a reflexion of that splendid and wanton old feudal life for here is in her original essence and meaning equivalent to demeterthe one living spirit of the earth divined behind the veil of all its manifold visible energies but in the development of a common mythological motive the various peoples are subject to the general limitations of their life and thought they can but work outward what is within them and the religious conceptions and usages ultimately derivable from one and the same rudimentary instinct are sometimes most diverse out of the visible physical energies of the earth and its system of annual change the old pelasgian mind developed the person of demeter mystical and profoundly aweful yet profoundly pathetic also in her appeal to human sympathies out of the same original elements the civilisation of argos on the other hand developes the religion of queen here a mere demeter at best of gaudy flowerbeds whose toilet homer describes with all its delicate fineries though characteristically he may still allow us to detect perhaps some traces of the mystical person of the earth in the allpervading scent of the ambrosial unguent with which she anoints herself in the abundant tresses of her hair and in the curious variegation of her ornaments she has become though with some reminiscence of the mystical earth a very limited human person wicked angry jealousthe lady of zeus in her castlesanctuary at mycenae in wanton dalliance with the king coaxing him for cruel purposes in sweet sleep adding artificial charms to her beauty such are some of the characteristics with which greek art is discernible in that earliest age of themselves they almost answer the question which next ariseswhence did art come to greece or was it a thing of absolutely native growth there so some have decidedly maintained others who lived in an age possessing little or no knowledge of greek monuments anterior to the full development of art under pheidias and who in regard to the greek sculpture of the age of pheidias were like people criticising michelangelo without knowledge of the earlier tuscan schoolof the works of donatello and mino da fiesoleeasily satisfied themselves with theories of its importation readymade from other countries critics in the last century especially noticing some characteristics which early greek work has in common indeed with egyptian art but which are common also to all such early work everywhere supposed as a matter of course that it came as the greek religion also from egyptthat old immemorial halfknown birthplace of all wonderful things there are it is true authorities for this derivation among the greeks themselves dazzled as they were by the marvels of the ancient civilisation of egypt a civilisation so different from their own on the first opening of egypt to greek visitors but in fact that opening did not take place till the reign of psammetichus about the middle of the seventh century bc a relatively late date psammetichus introduced and settled greek mercenaries in egypt and for a time the greeks came very close to egyptian life they can hardly fail to have been stimulated by that display of every kind of artistic workmanship gleaming over the whole of life they may in turn have freshened it with new motives and we may remark that but for the peculiar usage of egypt concerning the tombs of the dead but for their habit of investing the last abodes of the dead with all the appurtenances of active life out of that whole world of art so various and elaborate nothing but the great monumental works in stone would have remained to ourselves we should have experienced in regard to it what we actually experience too much in our knowledge of greek artthe lack of a fitting background in the smaller tectonic work for its great works in architecture and the bolder sort of sculpture but one by one at last as in the medieval parallel monuments illustrative of the earlier growth of greek art before the time of pheidias have come to light and to a just appreciation they show that the development of greek art had already proceeded some way before the opening of egypt to the greeks and point if to a foreign source at all to oriental rather than egyptian influences and the theory which derived greek art with many other greek things from egypt now hardly finds supporters in greece all things are at once old and new as in physical organisms the actual particles of matter have existed long before in other combinations and what is really new in a new organism is the new cohering forcethe mode of lifeso in the products of greek civilisation the actual elements are traceable elsewhere by antiquarians who care to trace them the elements for instance of its peculiar national architecture yet all is also emphatically autochthonous as the greeks said newborn at home by right of a new informing combining spirit playing over those mere elements and touching them above all with a wonderful sense of the nature and destiny of manthe dignity of his soul and of his bodyso that in all things the greeks are as discoverers still the original and primary motive seems in matters of art to have come from without and the view to which actual discovery and all true analogies more and more point is that of a connexion of the origin of greek art ultimately with assyria proximately with phoenicia partly through asia minor and chiefly through cyprusan original connexion again and again reasserted like a surviving trick of inheritance as in later times it came in contact with the civilisation of caria and lycia old affinities being here linked anew and with a certain asiatic tradition of which one representative is the ionic style of architecture traceable all through greek artan asiatic curiousness or poikilia strongest in that heroic age of which i have been speaking and distinguishing some schools and masters in greece more than others and always in appreciable distinction from the more clearly defined and selfasserted hellenic influence homer himself witnesses to the intercourse through early adventurous commerce as in the bright and animated picture with which the history of herodotus begins between the greeks and eastern countries we may perhaps forget sometimes thinking over the greatness of its place in the history of civilisation how small a country greece really was how short the distances upwards from island to island to the coast of asia so that we can hardly make a sharp separation between asia and greece nor deny besides great and palpable acts of importation all sorts of impalpable asiatic influences by way alike of attraction and repulsion upon greek manners and taste homer as we saw was right in making troy essentially a greek city with inhabitants superior in all culture to their kinsmen on the western shore and perhaps proportionally weaker on the practical or moral side and with an element of languid ionian voluptuousness in them typified by the cedar and gold of the chamber of parisan element which the austere more strictly european influence of the dorian apollo will one day correct in all genuine greeks the aegean with its islands is then a bond of union not a barrier and we must think of greece as has been rightly said as its whole continuous shore the characteristics of greek art indeed in the heroic age so far as we can discern them are those also of phoenician art its delight in metal among the rest of metal especially as an element in architecture the covering of everything with plates of metal it was from phoenicia that the costly material in which early greek art delighted actually cameivory amber much of the precious metals these the adventurous phoenician traders brought in return for the mussel which contained the famous purple in quest of which they penetrated far into all the greek havens recent discoveries present the island of cyprus the great source of copper and copper work in ancient times as the special mediator between the art of phoenicia and greece and in some archaic figures of aphrodite with her dove brought from cyprus and now in the british museumobjects you might think at first sight taken from the niches of a french gothic cathedralare some of the beginnings at least of greek sculpture manifestly under the influence of phoenician masters and again mythology is the reflex of characteristic facts it is through cyprus that the religion of aphrodite comes from phoenicia to greece here in cyprus she is connected with some other kindred elements of mythological tradition above all with the beautiful old story of pygmalion in which the thoughts of art and love are connected so closely together first of all on the prows of the phoenician ships the tutelary image of aphrodite euploea the protectress of sailors comes to cyprusto cythera it is in this simplest sense that she is primarily anadyomene and her connexion with the arts is always an intimate one in cyprus her worship is connected with an architecture not colossal but full of dainty splendourthe art of the shrinemaker the maker of reliquaries the art of the toilet the toilet of aphrodite the homeric hymn to aphrodite is full of all that delight in which we have seen to be characteristic of the true homer and now we see why hephaestus that crookbacked and uncomely god is the husband of aphrodite hephaestus is the god of fire indeed as fire he is flung from heaven by zeus and in the marvellous contest between achilles and the river xanthus in the twentyfirst book of the iliad he intervenes in favour of the hero as mere fire against water but he soon ceases to be thus generally representative of the functions of fire and becomes almost exclusively representative of one only of its aspects its function namely in regard to early art he becomes the patron of smiths bent with his labour at the forge as people had seen such real workers he is the most perfectly developed of all the daedali mulcibers or cabeiri that the god of fire becomes the god of all art architecture included so that he makes the houses of the gods and is also the husband of aphrodite marks a threefold group of facts the prominence first of a peculiar kind of art in early greece that beautiful metalwork with which he is bound and bent secondly the connexion of this through aphrodite with an almost wanton personal splendour the connexion thirdly of all this with cyprus and phoenicia whence literally aphrodite comes hephaestus is the of the asiatic element in greek art this then is the situation which the first period of greek art comprehends a people whose civilisation is still young delighting as the young do in ornament in the sensuous beauty of ivory and gold in all the lovely productions of skilled fingers they receive all this together with the worship of aphrodite by way of cyprus from phoenicia from the older decrepit eastern civilisation itself long since surfeited with that splendour and they receive it in frugal quantity so frugal that their thoughts always go back to the east where there is the fulness of it as to a wonderland of art received thus in frugal quantity through many generations that world of asiatic tectonics stimulates the sensuous capacity in them accustoms the hand to produce and the eye to appreciate the more delicately enjoyable qualities of material things but nowhere in all this various and exquisite world of design is there as yet any adequate sense of man himself nowhere is there an insight into or power over human form as the expression of human soul yet those arts of design in which that younger people delights have in them already as designed work that spirit of reasonable order that expressive congruity in the adaptation of means to ends of which the fully developed admirableness of human form is but the consummation a consummation already anticipated in the grand and animated figures of epic poetry their power of thought their laughter and tears under the hands of that younger people as they imitate and pass largely and freely beyond those older craftsmen the fire of the reasonable soul will kindle little by little up to the theseus of the parthenon and the venus of melos the ideal aim of greek sculpture as of all other art is to deal indeed with the deepest elements of mans nature and destiny to command and express these but to deal with them in a manner and with a kind of expression as clear and graceful and simple if it may be as that of the japanese flowerpainter and what the student of greek sculpture has to cultivate generally in himself is the capacity for appreciating the expression of thought in outward form the constant habit of associating sense with soul of tracing what we call expression to its sources but concurrently with this he must also cultivate all along a not less equally constant appreciation of intelligent workmanship in work and of design in things designed of the rational control of matter everywhere from many sources he may feed this sense of intelligence and design in the productions of the minor crafts above all in the various and exquisite art of japan carrying a delicacy like that of nature itself into every form of imitation reproduction and combination leaf and flower fish and bird reed and waterand failing only when it touches the sacred human form that art of japan is not so unlike the earliest stages of greek art as might at first sight be supposed we have here and in no mere fragments the spectacle of a universal application to the instruments of daily life of fitness and beauty in a temper still unsophisticated as also unelevated by the divination of the spirit of man and at least the student must always remember that greek art was throughout a much richer and warmer thing at once with more shadows and more of a dim magnificence in its surroundings than the illustrations of a classical dictionary might induce him to think some of the ancient temples of greece were as rich in aesthetic curiosities as a famous modern museum that asiatic poikilia that spirit of minute and curious loveliness follows the bolder imaginative efforts of greek art all through its history and one can hardly be too careful in keeping up the sense of this daintiness of execution through the entire course of its development it is not only that the minute object of art the tiny vasepainting intaglio coin or cameo often reduces into the palm of the hand lines grander than those of many a lifesized or colossal figure but there is also a sense in which it may be said that the venus of melos for instance is but a supremely wellexecuted object of vertu in the most limited sense of the term those solemn images of the temple of theseus are a perfect embodiment of the human ideal of the reasonable soul and of a spiritual world they are also the best made things of their kind as an urn or a cup is well made a perfect manysided development of tectonic crafts a state such as the art of some nations has ended in becomes for the greeks a mere opportunity a mere startingground for their imaginative presentment of man moral and inspired a world of material splendour moulded clay beaten gold polished stonethe informing reasonable soul entering into that reclaiming the metal and stone and clay till they are as full of living breath as the real warm body itself the presence of those two elements is continuous throughout the fortunes of greek art after the heroic age and the constant right estimate of their action and reaction from period to period its

almost colourless background its real background as i have tried to show was a world of exquisite craftsmanship touching the minutest details of daily life with splendour and skill in close correspondence with a peculiarly animated development of human existencethe energetic movement and stir of typically noble human forms quite worthily clothedamid scenery as poetic as titians if shapes of colourless stone did come into that background it was as the undraped human form comes into some of titians pictures only to cool and solemnise its splendour the work of the greek sculptor being seldom in quite colourless stone nor always or chiefly in fastidiously selected marble even but often in richly toned metal and in its consummate products chryselephantinework in gold and ivory on a core of cedar pheidias in the olympian zeus in the athene of the parthenon fulfils what that primitive heroic goldsmiths age dimly discerned in homer already delighted in and the celebrated work of which i have first to speak now and with which greek sculpture emerges from that halfmythical age and becomes in a certain sense historical is a link in that goldsmiths or chryselephantine tradition carrying us forwards to the work of pheidias backwards to the elaborate asiatic furniture of the chamber of paris when pausanias visited olympia towards the end of the second century after christ he beheld among other precious objects in the temple of here a splendidly wrought treasurechest of cedarwood in which according to a legend quick as usual with the true human colouring the mother of cypselus had hidden him when a child from the enmity of her family the bacchiadae then the nobility of corinth the child named cypselus after this incident became tyrant of corinth and his grateful descendants as it was said offered the beautiful old chest to the temple of here as a memorial of his preservation that would have been not long after the year bc so much for the story which pausanias heardbut inherent probability and some points of detail in his description tend to fix the origin of the chest at a date at least somewhat later and as herodotus telling the story of the concealment of cypselus does not mention the dedication of the chest at olympia at all it may perhaps have been only one of many later imitations of antique art but whatever its date pausanias certainly saw the thing and has left a long description of it and we may trust his judgment at least as to its archaic style we have here then something plainly visible at a comparatively recent date something quite different from those perhaps wholly mythical objects described in homeran object which seemed to so experienced an observer as pausanias an actual work of earliest greek art relatively to later greek art it may have seemed to him what the ancient bronze doors with their scripture histories which we may still see in the south transept of the cathedral of pisa are to later italian art pausanias tells us nothing as to its size nor directly as to its shape it may for anything he says have been oval but it was probably rectangular with a broad front and two narrow sides standing as the maker of it had designed against the wall for in enumerating the various subjects wrought upon it in five rows one above another he seems to proceed beginning at the bottom on the righthand side along the front from right to left and then back again through the second row from left to right and alternating thus upwards to the last subject at the top on the lefthand side the subjects represented most of which had their legends attached in difficult archaic writing were taken freely though probably with a leading idea out of various poetic cycles as treated in the works of those socalled cyclic poets who continued the homeric tradition pausanias speaks as homer does in his description of the shield of achilles of a kind and amount of expression in feature and gesture certainly beyond the compass of any early art and we may believe we have in these touches only what the visitor heard from enthusiastic exegetae the interpreters or sacristans though any one who has seen the bayeux tapestry for instance must recognise the pathos and energy of which when really prompted by genius even the earliest hand is capable some ingenious attempts have been made to restore the grouping of the scenes with a certain formal expansion or balancing of subjects their figures and dimensions in true assyrian manner on the front and sides we notice some fine emblematic figures the germs of great artistic motives in after times already playing their parts theredeath and sleep and night but what is most noticeable is as i have already said that this work like the chamber of paris like the zeus of pheidias is chryselephantine its main fabric cedar and the figures upon it partly of ivory partly of gold but partly wrought out of the wood of the chest itself and as we read the description we can hardly help distributing in fancy gold and ivory respectively to their appropriate functions in the representation the cup of dionysus and the wings of certain horses there pausanias himself tells us were golden were not the apples of the hesperides the necklace of eriphyle the bridles the armour the unsheathed sword in the hand of amphiaraus also of gold were not the other children like the white image of sleep especially the naked child alcmaeon of ivory with alcestis and helen and that one of the dioscuri whose beard was still ungrown were not ivory and gold again combined in the throne of hercules and in the three goddesses conducted before paris the fitly introduces the first historical period of greek art a period coming down to about the year bc and the government of pisistratus at athens a period of tyrants like cypselus and pisistratus himself men of strong sometimes unscrupulous individuality but often also acute and cultivated patrons of the arts it begins with a series of inventions one here and another thereinventions still for the most part technical but which are attached to single names for with the growth of art the influence of individuals gifted for the opening of new ways more and more defines itself and the school open to all comers from which in turn the disciples may pass to all parts of greece takes the place of the family in which the knowledge of art descends as a tradition from father to son or of the mere tradeguild of these early industries we know little but the stray notices of pausanias often ambiguous always of doubtful credibility what we do see through these imperfect notices is a real period of animated artistic activity richly rewarded byzes of naxos for instance is recorded as having first adopted the plan of sawing marble into thin plates for use on the roofs of temples instead of tiles and that his name has come down to us at all testifies to the impression this fair white surface made on its first spectators various islands of the aegean become each the source of some new artistic device it is a period still under the reign of hephaestus delighting above all in magnificent metalwork says herodotus that was in the thirtyseventh olympiad and may be regarded as characteristic of the age for the popular imagination a kind of glamour some mysterious connexion of the thing with human fortunes still attaches to the curious product of artistic hands to the ring of polycrates for instance with its early specimen of engraved smaragdus as to the mythical necklace of harmonia pheidon of argos first makes coined money and the obeliscithe old nailshaped iron money now disused are hung up in the temple of here for even thus early the temples are in the way of becoming museums names like those of eucheir and eugrammus who were said to have taken the art of baking clay vases from samos to etruria have still a legendary air yet may be real surnames as in the case of smilis whose name is derived from a gravers tool and who made the ancient image of here at samos corinthmater statuariaebecomes a great nursery of art at an early time some time before the twentyninth olympiad butades of sicyon the potter settled there the record of early inventions in greece is sometimes fondly coloured with human sentiment or incident it is on the butterfly wing of such an incidentthe lovesick daughter of the artist who outlines on the wall the profile of her lover as he sleeps in the lamplight to keep by her in absencethat the name of butades the potter has come down to us the father fills up the outline long preserved it was believed in the nymphaeum at corinth and hence the art of modelling from the life in clay he learns further a way of colouring his clay red and fixes his masks along the temple eaves the temple of athene chalcioecusathene of the brazen houseat sparta the work of gitiades celebrated about this time as architect statuary and poet who made besides the image in her shrine and besides other dorian songs a hymn to the goddesswas so called from its crust or lining of bronze plates setting forth in richly embossed imagery various subjects of ancient legend what pausanias who saw it describes is like an elaborate development of that method of covering the interiors of stone buildings with metal plates of which the at mycenae is the earliest historical and the house of alcinous the heroic type in the pages of pausanias that glitter which ulysses stood still to wonder at may still be felt and on the right hand of this he tells us stood an image of zeus also of bronze the most ancient of all images of bronze this had not been cast nor wrought out of a single mass of metal but the various parts having been finished separately had been fitted together with nails or rivets that was the earliest method of uniting the various parts of a work in metalimage or vessel or breastplatea method allowing of much dainty handling of the cunning pins and rivets and one which has its place still in perfectly accomplished metalwork as in the equestrian statue of bartolomeo coleoni by andrea verrocchio in the piazza of st john and st paul at venice in the british museum there is a very early specimen of ita large eggshaped vessel fitted together of several pieces the projecting pins or rivets forming a sort of diadem round the middle being still sharp in form and heavily gilt that method gave place in time to a defter means of joining the parts together with more perfect unity and smoothness of surface the art of soldering and the invention of this artof soldering iron in the first instanceis coupled with the name of glaucus of chios a name which in connexion with this and other devices for facilitating the mechanical processes of artfor perfecting artistic effect with economy of labourbecame proverbial the being attributed to those who work well with rapidity and ease far more fruitful still was the invention of casting of casting hollow figures especially attributed to rhoecus and theodorus architects of the great temple at samos such hollow figures able in consequence of their lightness to rest almost like an inflated bladder on a single pointthe entire bulk of a heroic rider for instance on the point of his horses tailadmit of a much freer distribution of the whole weight or mass required than is possible in any other mode of statuary and the invention of the art of casting is really the discovery of liberty in composition and at last about the year bc we come to the first true school of sculptors the first clear example as we seem to discern of a communicable style reflecting and interpreting some real individuality in the masters who evolved it conveyed to disciples who came to acquire it from distant places and taking root through them at various centres where the names of the masters became attached of course to many fair works really by the hands of the pupils dipoenus and scyllis these first true masters were born in crete but their work is connected mainly with sicyon at that time the chief seat of greek art it is said that story too as we shall see illustrates the spirit of the age for their sculpture they used the white marble of paros being workers in marble especially though they worked also in ebony and in ivory and made use of gilding kedrou zôdia chrysô diênthismenapausanias says exquisitely describing a certain work of their pupil dontas of lacedaemon it is to that that we have definitely come at last in the school of dipoenus and scyllis dry and brief as these details may seem they are the witness to an active eager animated period of inventions and beginnings in which the greek workman triumphs over the first rough mechanical difficulties which beset him in the endeavour to record what his soul conceived of the form of priest or athlete then alive upon the earth or of the everliving gods then already more seldom seen upon it our own fancy must fill up the story of the unrecorded patience of the workshop into which we seem to peep through these scanty noticesthe fatigue the disappointments the steps repeated ending at last in that moment of success which is all pausanias records somewhat uncertainly and as this period begins with the chest of cypselus so it ends with a work in some respects similar also seen and described by pausaniasthe throne as he calls it of the amyclaean apollo it was the work of a wellknown artist bathycles of magnesia who probably about the year bc with a company of workmen came to the little ancient town of amyclae near sparta a place full of traditions of the heroic age he had been invited thither to perform a peculiar taskthe construction of a throne not like the throne of the olympian zeus and others numerous in after times for a seated figure but for the image of the local apollo no other than a rude and very ancient pillar of bronze thirty cubits high to which hermeswise head arms and feet were attached the thing stood upright as on a base upon a kind of tomb or reliquary in which according to tradition lay the remains of the young prince hyacinth son of the founder of that place beloved by apollo for his beauty and accidentally struck dead by him in play with a quoit from the drops of the lads blood had sprung up the purple flower of his name which bears on its petals the letters of the ejaculation of woe and in his memory the famous games of amyclae were celebrated beginning about the time of the longest day when the flowers are stricken by the sun and begin to fadea festival marked amid all its splendour with some real melancholy and serious thought of the dead in the midst of the of bathycles this sacred receptacle with the strange halfhumanised pillar above it was to stand probably in the open air within a consecrated enclosure like the chest of cypselus the throne was decorated with reliefs of subjects taken from epic poetry and it had supporting figures unfortunately what pausanias tells us of this monument hardly enables one to present it to the imagination with any completeness or certainty its dimensions he himself was unable exactly to ascertain and he does not tell us its material there are reasons however for supposing that it was of metal and amid these ambiguities the decorations of its base the grave or altartomb of hyacinth shine out clearly and are also for the most part clear in their significance it was as if many lines of solemn thought had been meant to unite about the restingplace of this local adonis in imageries full of some dim promise of immortal life but it was not so much in care for old idols as in the making of new ones that greek art was at this time engaged this whole first period of greek art might indeed be called the period of graven images and all its workmen sons of daedalus for daedalus is the mythical or all but mythical representative of all those arts which are combined in the making of lovelier idols than had heretofore been seen the old greek word which is at the root of the name daedalus the name of a craft rather than a proper name probably means to work curiouslyall curiously beautiful woodwork is daedal work the main point about the curiously beautiful chamber in which nausicaa sleeps in the odyssey being that like some exquisite swiss châlet it is wrought in wood but it came about that those workers in wood whom daedalus represents the early craftsmen of crete especially were chiefly concerned with the making of religious images like the carvers of berchtesgaden and oberammergau the sort of daintily finished images of the objects of public or private devotion which such workmen would turn out wherever there was a wooden idol in any way fairer than others finished perhaps sometimes with colour and gilding and appropriate real dress there the hand of daedalus had been that such images were quite detached from pillar or wall that they stood free and were statues in the proper sense showed that greek art was already liberated from its earlier eastern associations such freestanding being apparently unknown in assyrian art and then the effect of this daedal skill in them was that they came nearer to the proper form of humanity it is the wonderful lifelikeness of these early images which tradition celebrates in many anecdotes showing a very early instinctive turn for and delight in naturalism in the greek temper as cimabue in his day was able to charm men almost as with illusion by the simple device of halfclosing the eyelids of his personages and giving them instead of round eyes eyes that seemed to be in some degree sentient and to feel the light so the marvellous progress in those daedal wooden images was that the eyes were open so that they seemed to lookthe feet separated so that they seemed to walk greek art is thus almost from the first essentially distinguished from the art of egypt by an energetic striving after truth in organic form in representing the human figure egyptian art had held by mathematical or mechanical proportions exclusively the greek apprehends of it as the main truth that it is a living organism with freedom of movement and hence the infinite possibilities of motion and of expression by motion with which the imagination credits the higher sort of greek sculpture while the figures of egyptian art graceful as they often are seem absolutely incapable of any motion or gesture other than the one actually designed the work of the greek sculptor together with its more real anatomy becomes full also of human soul that old primitive mystical first period of greek religion with its profound though halfconscious intuitions of spiritual powers in the natural world attaching itself not to the worship of visible human forms but to relics to natural or halfnatural objectsthe roughly hewn tree the unwrought stone the pillar the holy cone of aphrodite in her dimlylighted cell at paphoshad passed away the second stage in the development of greek religion had come a period in which poet and artist were busily engaged in the work of incorporating all that might be retained of the vague divinations of that earlier visionary time in definite and intelligible human image and human story the vague belief the mysterious custom and tradition develope themselves into an elaborately ordered ritual into personal gods imaged in ivory and gold sitting on beautiful thrones always wherever a shrine or temple great or small is mentioned there we may conclude was a visible idol there was conceived to be the actual dwellingplace of a god and this understanding became not less but more definite as the temple became larger and more splendid full of ceremony and servants like the abode of an earthly king and as the sacred presence itself assumed little by little the last beauties and refinements of the visible human form and expression in what we have seen of this first period of greek art in all its curious essays and inventions we may observe this demand for beautiful idols increasing in greecefor sacred images at first still rude and in some degree the holier for their rudeness but which yet constitute the beginnings of the religious style consummate in the work of pheidias uniting the veritable image of man in the full possession of his reasonable soul with the true religious mysticity the signature there of something from afar one by one these new gods of bronze or marble or fleshlike ivory take their thrones at this or that famous shrine like the images of this period which pausanias saw in the temple of here at olympiathe throned seasons with themis as the mother of the seasons and fortune and victory and kore and demeter and dionysus already visibly there around the image of here herself seated on a throne and all chryselephantine all in gold and ivory novel as these things are they still undergo consecration at their first erecting the figure of athene in her brazen temple at sparta the work of gitiades who makes also the image and the hymn in triple service to the goddess and again that curious story of dipoenus and scyllis brought back with so much awe to remove the public curse by completing their sacred task upon the images show how simply religious the age still wasthat this widespread artistic activity was a religious enthusiasm also those early sculptors have still for their contemporaries a divine mission with some kind of hieratic or sacred quality in their gift distinctly felt the development of the artist in the proper sense out of the mere craftsman effected in the first division of this period is now complete and in close connexion with that busy graving of religious images which occupies its second division we come to something like real personalities to men with individual characteristicssuch men as ageladas of argos callon and onatas of aegina and canachus of sicyon mere fragment as our information concerning these early masters is at the best it is at least unmistakeably information about men with personal differences of temper and talent of their motives of what we call style we have come to a sort of art which is no longer broadly characteristic of a general period one whose products we might have looked at without its occurring to us to ask concerning the artist his antecedents and his school we have to do now with types of art fully impressed with the subjectivity the intimacies of the artist among these freer and stronger personalities emerging thus about the beginning of the fifth century before christabout the period of the persian warthe name to which most of this sort of personal quality attaches and which is therefore very interesting is the name of canachus of sicyon who seems to have comprehended in himself all the various attainments in art which had been gradually developed in the schools of his native citycarver in wood sculptor brasscutter and toreutes by toreuticê being meant the whole art of statuary in metals and in their combination with other materials at last we seem to see an actual person at work and to some degree can follow with natural curiosity the motions of his spirit and his hand we seem to discern in all we know of his productions the results of individual apprehensionthe results as well as the limitations of an individual talent it is impossible to date exactly the chief period of the activity of canachus that the great image of apollo which he made for the milesians was carried away to ecbatana by the persian army is stated by pausanias but there is a doubt whether this was under xerxes as pausanias says in the year bc or twenty years earlier under darius so important a work as this colossal image of apollo for so great a shrine as the didymaeum was probably the task of his maturity and his career may therefore be regarded as having begun at any rate prior to the year bc and the end of the persian invasion the event which may be said to close this period of art on the whole the chief period of his activity is thought to have fallen earlier and to have occupied the last forty years of the previous century and he would thus have flourished as we say about fifty years before the manhood of pheidias as mino of fiesole fifty years before the manhood of michelangelo his chief works were an aphrodite wrought for the sicyonians in ivory and gold that apollo of bronze carried away by the persians and restored to its place about the year bc and a reproduction of the same work in cedarwood for the sanctuary of apollo of the ismenus at thebes the primitive greek worship as we may trace it in homer presents already on a minor scale all the essential characteristics of the most elaborate greek worship of after times the sacred enclosure the incense and other offerings the prayer of the priest the shrine itselfa small one roofed in by the priest with green boughs not unlike a wayside chapel in modern times and understood to be the dwellingplace of the divine personwithin almost certainly an idol with its own sacred apparel a visible form little more than symbolical perhaps like the sacred pillar for which bathycles made his throne at amyclae but if an actual image certainly a rude one that primitive worship traceable in almost all these particulars even in the first book of the iliad had given place before the time of canachus at sicyon to a more elaborate ritual and a more completely designed imagework and a little bronze statue discovered on the site of tenea where apollo was the chief object of worship the best representative of many similar marble figures those of thera and orchomenus for instanceis supposed to represent apollo as this still early age conceived himyouthful naked muscular and with the germ of the greek profile but formally smiling and with a formal diadem or fillet over the long hair which shows him to be no mortal athlete the hands like the feet excellently modelled are here extended downwards at the sides but in some similar figures the hands are lifted and held straight outwards with the palms upturned the apollo of canachus also had the hands thus raised and on the open palm of the right hand was placed a stag while with the left he grasped the bow pliny says that the stag was an automaton with a mechanical device for setting it in motion a detail which hints at least at the subtlety of workmanship with which those ancient critics who had opportunity of knowing credited this early artist of this work itself nothing remains but we possess perhaps some imitations of it it is probably this most sacred possession of the place which the coins of miletus display from various points of view though of course only on the smallest scale but a little bronze figure in the british museum with the stag in the right hand and in the closed left hand the hollow where the bow has passed is thought to have been derived from it and its points of style are still further illustrated by a marble head of similar character also preserved in the british museum which has many marks of having been copied in marble from an original in bronze a really ancient work or only archaic it certainly expresses together with all that careful patience and hardness of workmanship which is characteristic of an early age a certain apolline strengtha pride and dignity in the features so steadily composed below the stiff archaic arrangement of the long filletbound locks it is the exact expression of that midway position between an involved archaic stiffness and the free play of individual talent which is attributed to canachus by the ancients his apollo of cedarwood which inhabited a temple near the gates of thebes on a rising ground below which flowed the river ismenus had according to pausanias so close a resemblance to that at miletus that it required little skill in one who had seen either of them to tell what master had designed the other still though of the same dimensions while one was of cedar the other was of bronze a reproduction one of the other we may believe but with the modifications according to the use of good workmen even so early as canachus due to the difference of the material for the likeness between the two statues it is to be observed is not the mechanical likeness of those earlier images represented by the statuette of tenea which spoke not of the style of one master but only of the manufacture of one workshop in those two images of canachusthe milesian apollo and the apollo of the ismenusthere were resemblances amid differences resemblances as we may understand in what was nevertheless peculiar novel and even innovating in the precise conception of the god therein set forth resemblances which spoke directly of a single workman though working freely of one hand and one fancy a likeness in that which could by no means be truly copied by another it was the beginning of what we mean by the style of a master together with all the novelty the innovating and improving skill which has made canachus remembered an attractive oldworld deeplyfelt mysticity seems still to cling about what we read of these early works that piety that religiousness of temper of which the people of sicyon had given proof so oddly in their dealings with those old carvers scyllis and dipoenus still survives in the master who was chosen to embody his own novelty of idea and execution in so sacred a place as the shrine of apollo at miletus something still conventional combined in these images with the effect of great artistic skill with a palpable beauty and power seems to have given them a really imposing religious character escaping from the rigid uniformities of the stricter archaic style he is still obedient to certain hieratic influences and traditions he is still reserved selfcontrolled composed or even mannered a little as in some sacred presence with the severity and strength of the early style but there are certain notices which seem to show that he had his purely poetical motives also as befitted his age motives which prompted works of mere fancy like his muse with the lyre symbolising the chromatic style of music aristocles his brother and ageladas of argos executing each another statue to symbolise the two other orders of music the riding boys of which pliny speaks like the mechanical stag on the hand of apollo which he also describes were perhaps mechanical toys as benvenuto cellini made toys in the beardless aesculapius againthe image of the god of healing not merely as the son of apollo but as one ever youngit is the poetry of sculpture that we see this poetic feeling and the piety of temper so deeply impressed upon his images of apollo seem to have been combined in his chryselephantine aphrodite as we see it very distinctly in pausanias enthroned with an apple in one hand and a poppy in the other and with the sphere or polos about the head in its quaint little temple or chapel at sicyon with the hierokêpis or holy garden about it this is what canachus has to give us instead of the strange symbolical cone with the lights burning around it in its dark cellthe form under which aphrodite was worshipped at her famous shrine of paphos pausanias tells us that is a place one would certainly have liked to see so real it seemsthe seated image the people gazing through the doorway the fragrant odour must it not still be in secret keeping somewhere we are almost tempted to ask maintained by some few solitary worshippers surviving from age to age among the villagers of achaia in spite of many obscurities it may be said that what we know and what we do not know of canachus illustrates the amount and sort of knowledge we possess about the artists of the period which he best represents a naïvetéa freshness an earlyaged simplicity and sinceritythat we may believe had we their works before us would be for us their chief aesthetic charm cicero remarked that in contrast with the works of the next generation of sculptors there was a stiffness in the statues of canachus which made them seem untrue to nature but cicero belongs to an age surfeited with artistic licence and likely enough to undervalue the severity of the early masters the great motive struggling still with the minute and rigid hand so the critics of the last century ignored or underrated the works of the earlier tuscan sculptors in what cicero calls of canachus combined with what we seem to see of his poetry of conception his freshness his solemnity we may understand no really repellent hardness but only that earnest patience of labour the expression of which is constant in all the best work of an early time in the david of verrocchio for instance and in the early flemish painters as it is natural and becoming in youth itself the very touch of the struggling hand was upon the work but with the interest the halfrepressed animation of a great promise fulfilled as we now see in the magnificent growth of greek sculpture in the succeeding age which however for those earlier workmen meant the loins girt and the halffolded wings not yet quite at home in the air

daidallô the verb toreuô means now preserved at munich the marbles of aegina i have dwelt the more emphatically upon the purely sensuous aspects of early greek art on the beauty and charm of its mere material and workmanship the grace of hand in it its chryselephantine character because the direction of all the more general criticism since lessing has been somewhat onesidedly towards the ideal or abstract element in greek art towards what we may call its philosophical aspect and indeed this philosophical element a tendency to the realisation of a certain inward abstract intellectual ideal is also at work in greek arta tendency which if that chryselephantine influence is called ionian may rightly be called the dorian or in reference to its broader scope the european influence and this european influence or tendency is really towards the impression of an order a sanity a proportion in all work which shall reflect the inward order of human reason now fully conscious of itselftowards a sort of art in which the record and delineation of humanity as active in the wide inward world of its passion and thought has become more or less definitely the aim of all artistic handicraft in undergoing the action of these two opposing influences and by harmonising in itself their antagonism greek sculpture does but reflect the larger movements of more general greek history all through greek history we may trace in every sphere of the activity of the greek mind the action of these two opposing tendenciesthe centrifugal and centripetal tendencies as we may perhaps not too fancifully call them there is the centrifugal the ionian the asiatic tendency flying from the centre working with little forethought straight before it in the development of every thought and fancy throwing itself forth in endless play of undirected imagination delighting in brightness and colour in beautiful material in changeful form everywhere in poetry in philosophy even in architecture and its subordinate crafts in the social and political order it rejoices in the freest action of local and personal influences its restless versatility drives it towards the assertion of the principles of separatism of individualismthe separation of state from state the maintenance of local religions the development of the individual in that which is most peculiar and individual in him its claim is in its grace its freedom and happiness its lively interest the variety of its gifts to civilisation its weakness is selfevident and was what made the unity of greece impossible it is this centrifugal tendency which plato is desirous to cure by maintaining over against it the dorian influence of a severe simplification everywhere in society in culture in the very physical nature of man an enemy everywhere to variegation to what is cunning or he sets himself in mythology in music in poetry in every kind of art to enforce the ideal of a sort of parmenidean abstractness and calm this exaggerated ideal of platos is however only the exaggeration of that salutary european tendency which finding human mind the most absolutely real and precious thing in the world enforces everywhere the impress of its sanity its profound reflexions upon things as they really are its sense of proportion it is the centripetal tendency which links individuals to each other states to states one period of organic growth to another under the reign of a composed rational selfconscious order in the universal light of the understanding whether or not this temper so clearly traceable as a distinct influence in the course of greek development was indeed the peculiar gift of the dorian race certainly that race is the best illustration of it in its love of order of that severe composition everywhere of which the dorian style of architecture is as it were a material symbolin its constant aspiration after what is earnest and dignified as exemplified most evidently in the religion of its predilection the religion of apollo for as that ionian influence the chryselephantine influence had its patron in hephaestus belonged to the religion of hephaestus husband of aphrodite the representation of exquisite workmanship of fine art in metal coming from the east in close connexion with the artificial furtherance through dress and personal ornament of the beauty of the body so that dorian or european influence embodied itself in the religion of apollo for the development of this or that mythological conception from its root in fact or law of the physical world is very various in its course thus demeter the spirit of life in grassand dionysus the of life in the green sap remain to the end of mens thoughts and fancies about them almost wholly physical but apollo the of sunbeams early becomes exclusively ethicalthe of inward or intellectual light in all its manifestations he represents all those specially european ideas of a reasonable personal freedom as understood in greece of a reasonable polity of the sanity of soul and body through the cure of disease and of the sense of sin of the perfecting of both by reasonable exercise or ascêsis his religion is a sort of embodied equity its aim the realisation of fair reason and just consideration of the truth of things everywhere i cannot dwell on the general aspects of this subject further but i would remark that in art also the religion of apollo was a sanction of and an encouragement towards the true valuation of humanity in its sanity its proportion its knowledge of itself following after this greek art attained in its reproductions of human form not merely to the profound expression of the highest indwelling spirit of human intelligence but to the expression also of the great human passions of the powerful movements as well as of the calm and peaceful order of the soul as finding in the affections of the body a language the elements of which the artist might analyse and then combine order and recompose in relation to music to art to all those matters over which the muses preside apollo as distinct from hermes seems to be the representative and patron of what i may call reasonable music of a great intelligence at work in art of beauty attained through the conscious realisation of ideas they were the cities of the dorian affinity which early brought to perfection that most characteristic of greek institutions the sacred dance with the whole gymnastic system which was its natural accompaniment and it was the familiar spectacle of that living sculpture which developed perhaps beyond everything else in the greek mind at its best a sense of the beauty and significance of the human form into that bewildered dazzling world of minute and dainty handicraftthe chamber of paris the house of alcinousin which the form of man alone had no adequate place and as yet properly was not this dorian european apolline influence introduced the intelligent and spiritual human presence and gave it its true value a value consistently maintained to the end of greek art by a steady hold upon and preoccupation with the inward harmony and system of human personality in the works of the asiatic traditionthe marbles of nineveh for instanceand so far as we can see in the early greek art which derives from it as for example in the archaic remains from cyprus the form of man is inadequate and below the measure of perfection attained there in the representation of the lower forms of life just as in the little reflective art of japan so lovely in its reproduction of flower or bird the human form alone comes almost as a caricature or is at least untouched by any higher ideal to that asiatic tradition then with its perfect craftsmanship its consummate skill in design its power of hand the dorian the european the true hellenic influence brought a revelation of the soul and body of man and we come at last in the marbles of aegina to a monument which bears upon it the full expression of this humanismto a work in which the presence of man realised with complete mastery of hand and with clear apprehension of how he actually is and moves and looks is touched with the freshest sense of that newfound inward value the energy of worthy passions purifying the light of his reason shining through bodily forms and motions solemnised attractive pathetic we have reached an extant work real and visible of an importance out of all proportion to anything actually remaining of earlier art and justifying by its direct interest and charm our long prelude on the beginnings of greek sculpture while there was still almost nothing actually to see these fifteen figures of parian marble of about twothirds the size of life forming with some deficiencies the east and west gables of a temple of athene the ruins of which still stand on a hillside by the seashore in a remote part of the island of aegina were discovered in the year and having been purchased by the crown prince afterwards king louis i of bavaria are now the great ornament of the glyptothek or museum of sculpture at munich the group in each gable consisted of eleven figures and of the fifteen larger figures discovered five belong to the eastern ten to the western gable so that the western gable is complete with the exception of one figure which should stand in the place to which as the groups are arranged at munich the beautiful figure bending down towards the fallen leader has been actually transferred from the eastern gable certain fragments showing that the lost figure corresponded essentially to this which has therefore been removed hither from its place in the less complete group to which it properly belongs for there are two legitimate views or motives in the restoration of ancient sculpture the antiquarian and the aesthetic as they may be termed respectively the former limiting itself to the bare presentation of what actually remains of the ancient work braving all shock to living eyes from the mutilated nose or chin while the latter the aesthetic method requires that with the least possible addition or interference by the most skilful living hand procurable the object shall be made to please or at least content the living eye seeking enjoyment and not a bare fact of science in the spectacle of ancient art this latter way of restorationthe aesthetic wayfollowed by the famous connoisseurs of the renaissance has been followed here and the visitor to munich actually sees the marbles of aegina as restored after a model by the tasteful hand of thorwaldsen different views have however been maintained as to the right grouping of the figures but the composition of the two groups was apparently similar not only in general character but in a certain degree of correspondence of all the figures each to each and in both the subject is a combata combat between greeks and asiatics concerning the body of a greek hero fallen among the foemenan incident so characteristic of the poetry of the heroic wars in both cases athene whose temple this sculpture was designed to decorate intervenes her image being complete in the western gable the head and some other fragments remaining of that in the eastern the incidents represented were probably chosen with reference to the traditions of aegina in connexion with the trojan war greek legend is ever deeply coloured by local interest and sentiment and this monument probably celebrates telamon and ajax his son the heroes who established the fame of aegina and whom the united greeks on the morning of the battle of salamis in which the aeginetans were distinguished above all other greeks in bravery invited as their peculiar spiritual allies from that island accordingly antiquarians are for the most part of opinion that the eastern gable represents the combat of hercules and of his comrade telamon against laomedon of troy in which properly hercules was leader but here as squire and archer is made to give the first place to telamon as the titular hero of the place opinion is not so definite regarding the subject of the western gable which however probably represents the combat between the greeks and trojans over the body of patroclus in both cases an aeginetan hero in the eastern gable telamon in the western his son ajax is represented in the extreme crisis of battle such a crisis as according to the deep religiousness of the greeks of that age was a motive for the visible intervention of the goddess in favour of her chosen people opinion as to the date of the work based mainly on the characteristics of the work itself has varied within a period ranging from the middle of the sixtieth to the middle of the seventieth olympiad inclining on the whole to the later date in the period of the ionian revolt against persia and a few years earlier than the battle of marathon in this monument then we have a revelation in the sphere of art of the temper which made the victories of marathon and salamis possible of the true spirit of greek chivalry as displayed in the persian war and in the highly ideal conception of its events expressed in herodotus and approving itself minutely to the minds of the greeks as a series of affairs in which the gods and heroes of old time personally intervened and that not as mere shadows it was natural that the highpitched temper the stress of thought and feeling which ended in the final conflict of greek liberty with asiatic barbarism should stimulate quite a new interest in the poetic legends of the earlier conflict between them in the heroic age as the events of the crusades and the chivalrous spirit of that period leading mens minds back to ponder over the deeds of charlemagne and his paladins gave birth to the composition of the song of roland just so this aeginetan sculpture displays the greeks of a later age feeding their enthusiasm on the legend of a distant past and is a link between herodotus and homer in those ideal figures pensive a little from the first we may suppose with the shadowiness of a past age we may yet see how greeks of the time of themistocles really conceived of homeric knight and squire some other fragments of art also discovered in aegina and supposed to be contemporary with the temple of athene tend by their roughness and immaturity to show that this small building so united in its effect so complete in its simplicity in the symmetry of its two main groups of sculpture was the perfect artistic flower of its time and place yet within the limits of this simple unity so important an element in the charm and impressiveness of the place a certain inequality of design and execution may be detected the hand of a slightly earlier master probably having worked in the western gable while the master of the eastern gable has gone some steps farther than he in fineness and power of expression the stooping figure of the supposed ajaxbelonging to the western group in the present arrangement but really borrowed as i said from the easternwhich has in it something above the type of the figures grouped round it being this later sculptors work yet overbeck who has elaborated the points of this distinction of styles commends without reserve the technical excellence of the whole work executed as he says it was the dorian cities plato tells us which first shook off the false asiatic shame and stripped off their clothing for purposes of exercise and training in the gymnasium and it was part of the dorian or european influence to assert the value in art of the unveiled and healthy human form and here the artists of aegina notwithstanding homers description of greek armour glowing like the sun itself have displayed the greek warriorsgreek and trojan alikenot in the equipments they would really have worn but nakedflesh fairer than that golden armour though more subdued and tranquil in effect on the spectator the undraped form of man coming like an embodiment of the hellenic spirit and as an element of temperance into the somewhat gaudy spectacle of asiatic or archaic art paris alone bears his dainty trappings characteristicallya coat of golden scalework the scales set on a lining of canvas or leather shifting deftly over the delicate body beneath and represented on the gable by the gilding or perhaps by real gilt metal it was characteristic also of that more truly hellenic artanother element of its temperanceto adopt the use of marble in its works and the material of these figures is the white marble of paros traces of colour have however been found on certain parts of them the outer surfaces of the shields and helmets have been blue their inner parts and the crests of the helmets red the hem of the drapery of athene the edges of her sandals the plinths on which the figures stand also red one quiver red another blue the eyes and lips too coloured perhaps the hair there was just a limited and conventionalised use of colour in effect upon the marble and although the actual material of these figures is marble its coolness and massiveness suiting the growing severity of greek thought yet they have their reminiscences of work in bronze in a certain slimness and tenuity a certain dainty lightness of poise in their grouping which remains in the memory as a peculiar note of their style the possibility of such easy and graceful balancing being one of the privileges or opportunities of statuary in cast metal of that hollow casting in which the whole weight of the work is so much less than that of a work of equal size in marble and which permits so much wider and freer a disposition of the parts about its centre of gravity in aegina the tradition of metalwork seems to have been strong and onatas whose name is closely connected with aegina and who is contemporary with the presumably later portion of this monument was above all a worker in bronze here again in this lurking spirit of metalwork we have a new element of complexity in the character of these precious remains and then to compass the whole work in our imagination we must conceive yet another element in the conjoint effect metal being actually mingled with the marble brought thus to its daintiest point of refinement as the little holes indicate bored into the marble figures for the attachment of certain accessories in bronzelances swords bows the medusas head on the aegis of athene and its fringe of little snakes and as there was no adequate consciousness and recognition of the essentials of mans nature in the older oriental art so there is no pathos no humanity in the more special sense but a kind of hardness and cruelty rather in those oftrepeated long matteroffact processions on the marbles of nineveh of slavelike soldiers on their way to battle mechanically or of captives on their way to slavery or death for the satisfaction of the great king these greek marbles on the contrary with that figure yearning forward so graciously to the fallen leader are deeply impressed with a natural pathetic effectthe true reflexion again of the temper of homer in speaking of war ares the god of war himself we must remember is according to his original import the god of storms of winter raging among the forests of the thracian mountains a brother of the north wind it is only afterwards that surviving many minor gods of war he becomes a leader of hosts a sort of divine knight and patron of knighthood and through the old intricate connexion of love and war and that amorousness which is the universally conceded privilege of the soldiers life he comes to be very near aphroditethe paramour of the goddess of physical beauty so that the idea of a sort of soft dalliance mingles in his character so unlike that of the christian leader saint george with the idea of savage warlike impulses the fair soft creature suddenly raging like a storm to which in its various wild incidents war is constantly likened in homer the effects of delicate youth and of tempest blending in ares into one expression not without that cruelty which mingles also like the influence of some malign fate upon him with the finer characteristics of achilles who is a kind of merely human double of ares and in homers impressions of war the same elements are blentthe delicacy the beauty of youth especially which makes it so fit for purposes of love spoiled and wasted by the random flood and fire of a violent tempest the glittering beauty of the greek expressed in so many brilliant figures and the splendour of their equipments in collision with the miserable accidents of battle and the grotesque indignities of death in it brought home to our fancy by a hundred pathetic incidentsthe sword hot with slaughter the stifling blood in the throat the spoiling of the body in every member severally he thinks of and records at his early ending the distant home from which the boy came who goes stumbling now just stricken so wretchedly his bowels in his hands he pushes the expression of this contrast to the macabre even suggesting the approach of those lower forms of life which await to morrow the fair bodies of the heroes who strive and fall today like these in the aeginetan gables for it is just that twofold sentiment which this sculpture has embodied the seemingly stronger hand which wrought the eastern gable has shown itself strongest in the rigid expression of the truth of pain in the mouth of the famous recumbent figure on the extreme left the lips just open at the corner and in the hardshut lips of hercules otherwise these figures all smile faintly almost like the monumental effigies of the middle age with a smile which even if it be but a result of the mere conventionality of an art still somewhat immature has just the pathetic effect of homers conventional epithet when he speaks of the flesh of his heroes and together with this touching power there is also in this work the effect of an early simplicity the charm of its limitations for as art which has passed its prime has sometimes the charm of an absolute refinement in taste and workmanship so immature art also as we now see has its own attractiveness in the naïveté the freshness of spirit which finds power and interest in simple motives of feeling and in the freshness of hand which has a sense of enjoyment in mechanical processes still performed unmechanically in the spending of care and intelligence on every touch as regards italian art the sculpture and paintings of the earlier renaissance the aesthetic value of this naïveté is now well understood but it has its value in greek sculpture also there too is a succession of phases through which the artistic power and purpose grew to maturity with the enduring charm of an unconventional unsophisticated freshness in that very early stage of it illustrated by these marbles of aegina not less than in the work of verrocchio and mino of fiesole effects of this we may note in that sculpture of aegina not merely in the simplicity or monotony even of the whole composition and in the exact and formal correspondence of one gable to the other but in the simple readiness with which the designer makes the two second spearmen kneel against the probability of the thing so as just to fill the space he has to compose in the profiles are still not yet of the fully developed greek type but have a somewhat sharp prominence of nose and chin as in etrurian design in the early sculpture of cyprus and in the earlier greek vases and the general proportions of the body in relation to the shoulders are still somewhat archaically slim but then the workman is at work in dry earnestness with a sort of hard strength in detail a scrupulousness verging on stiffness like that of an early flemish painter he communicates to us his still youthful sense of pleasure in the experience of the first rudimentary difficulties of his art overcome and withal these figures have in them a true expression of life of animation in this monument of greek chivalry pensive and visionary as it may seem those old greek knights live with a truth like that of homer or chaucer in a sort of stiff grace combined with a sense of things bright or sorrowful directly felt the aeginetan workman is as it were the chaucer of greek sculpture the age of athletic prizemen a chapter in greek art it is pleasant when looking at medieval sculpture we are reminded of that of greece pleasant likewise conversely in the study of greek work to be put on thoughts of the middle age to the refined intelligence it would seem there is something attractive in complex expression as such the marbles of aegina then may remind us of the middle age where it passes into the early renaissance of its most tenderly finished warriortombs at westminster or in florence a less mature phase of medieval art is recalled to our fancy by a primitive greek work in the museum of athens hermes bearing a ram a little one upon his shoulders he bears it thus had borne it round the walls of tanagra as its citizens told by way of purifying that place from the plague and brings to mind of course later images of the it is not the subject of the work however but its style that sets us down in thought before some gothic cathedral front suppose the hermes kriophorus lifted into one of those empty niches and the archaeologist will inform you rightly as at auxerre or wells of italian influence perhaps of italian workmen and along with them indirect old greek influence coming northwards while the connoisseur assures us that all good art at its respective stages of development is in essential qualities everywhere alike it is observed as a note of imperfect skill that in that carved block of stone the animal is insufficiently detached from the shoulders of its bearer again how precisely gothic is the effect its very limitation as sculpture emphasises the function of the thing as an architectural ornament and the student of the middle age if it came within his range would be right in so esteeming it hieratic stiff and formal if you will there is a knowledge of the human body in it nevertheless of the body and of the purely animal soul therein full of the promise of what is coming in that chapter of greek art which may properly be entitled that rude image a work perhaps of calamis of shadowy fame belongs to a phase of art still in graveclothes or swaddlingbands still strictly subordinate to religious or other purposes not immediately its own it had scarcely to wait for the next generation to be superseded and we need not wonder that but little of it remains but that it was a widely active phase of art with all the vigour of local varieties is attested by another famous archaic monument too full of a kind of sacred poetry to be passed by the reader does not need to be reminded that the greeks vivid as was their consciousness of this life cared much always for the graves of the dead that to be cared for to be honoured in ones grave to have tymbos amphipolos a frequented tomb as pindar says was a considerable motive with them even among the young in the study of its funeral monuments we might indeed follow closely enough the general development of art in greece from beginning to end the carved slab of the ancient shepherd of orchomenus with his dog and rustic staff the stélé of the ancient manatarms signed rich originally with colour and gold and fittings of bronze are among the few still visible pictures or portraits it may be of the earliest greek life compare them compare their expression for a moment with the deeply incised tombstones of the brethren of st francis and their clients which still roughen the pavement of santa croce at florence and recall the varnished polychrome decoration of those greek monuments in connexion with the wornout blazonry of the funeral brasses of england and flanders the shepherd the hoplite begin a series continuous to the era of full attic mastery in its gentlest mood with a large and varied store of memorials of the dead which not so strangely as it may seem at first sight are like selected pages from daily domestic life see for instance at the british museum trypho one of the very pleasantest human likenesses there though it came from a cemeterya son it was hard to leave in it at nineteen or twenty with all the suppleness the delicate muscularity of the flower of his youth his handsome face sweetened by a kind and simple heart in motion surely he steps forth from some shadowy chamber strigil in hand as of old and with his coarse towel or cloak of monumental drapery over one shoulder but whither precisely you may ask and as what is he moving there in the doorway well in effect certainly it is the memory of the dead lad emerging thus from his tombthe still active soul or permanent thought of him as he most liked to be the harpy tomb so called from its mysterious winged creatures with human faces carrying the little shrouded souls of the dead is a work many generations earlier than that graceful monument of trypho it was from an ancient cemetery at xanthus in lycia that it came to the british museum the lycians were not a greek people but as happened even with dwelling on the coast of asia minor they became lovers of the hellenic culture and xanthus their capital as may be judged from the beauty of its ruins managed to have a considerable portion in greek art though infusing it with a certain asiatic colour the frugally designed frieze of the harpy tomb in the lowest possible relief might fairly be placed between the monuments of assyria and those primitive greek works among which it now actually stands the stiffly ranged figures in any other than strictly archaic work would seem affected but what an undercurrent of refined sentiment presumably not asiatic not lifting those who felt thus about death so early into the main stream of greek humanity and to a level of visible refinement in execution duly expressive of it in that old burialplace of xanthus then a now nameless family or a single bereaved member of it represented there as a diminutive figure crouching on the earth in sorrow erected this monument so full of family sentiment and of so much value as illustrating what is for us a somewhat empty period in the history of greek art strictly so called like the less conspicuously adorned tombs around it like the tombs in homer it had the form of a towera square tower about twentyfour feet high hollowed at the top into a small chamber for the reception through a little doorway of the urned ashes of the dead four sculptured slabs were placed at this level on the four sides of the tower in the manner of a frieze i said that the winged creatures with human faces carry the little souls of the dead the interpretation of these mystic imageries is in truth debated but in face of them and remembering how the sculptors and glasspainters of the middle age constantly represented the souls of the dead as tiny bodies one can hardly doubt as to the meaning of these particular details which repeated on every side seem to give the keynote of the whole composition those infernal or celestial birds indeed are not true to what is understood to be the harpy form call them sirens rather people and not only old people as you know appear sometimes to have been quite charmed away by what dismays most of us the tiny shrouded figures which the sirens carry are carried very tenderly and seem to yearn in their turn towards those kindly nurses as they pass on their way to a new world their small stature as i said does not prove them infants but only newborn into that other life and contrasts their helplessness with the powers the great presences now around them a cow far enough from myrons famous illusive animal suckles her calf she is one of almost any number of artistic symbols of newbirth of the renewal of life drawn from a world which is after all so full of it on one side sits enthroned as some have thought the goddess of death on the opposite side the goddess of life with her flowers and fruit towards her three young maidens are advancingwere they still alive thus graceful virginal with their long plaited hair and long delicatelyfolded tunics looking forward to carry on their race into the future presented severally on the other sides of the dark hollow within three male personsa young man an old man and a boyseem to be bringing home somewhat wearily to their the young man his armour the boy and the old man like old socrates the mortuary cock as they approach some shadowy ancient deity of the tomb or it may be the throned impersonation of their the marble surface was coloured at least in part with fixtures of metal here and there the designer whoever he may have been was possessed certainly of some tranquillising second thoughts concerning death which may well have had their value for mourners and he has expressed those thoughts if lispingly yet with no faults of commission with a befitting grace and in truth at some points with something already of a really hellenic definition and vigour he really speaks to us in his work through his symbolic and imitative figuresspeaks to our intelligence persuasively the surviving thought of the lad trypho returning from his tomb to the living was of athletic character how he was and looked when in the flower of his strength and it is not of the dead but of the living who look and are as he that the artistic genius of this period is full it is a period truly not of battles such as those commemorated in the marbles of aegina but of more peaceful contests at olympia at the isthmus at delphithe glories of which pindar sang in language suggestive of a sort of metallic beauty firmly cut and embossed like crowns of wild olive of parsley and bay in crisp gold first however it had been necessary that greece should win its liberty political standingground and a really social air to breathe in with development of the youthful limbs of this process athens was the chief scene and the earliest notable presentment of humanity by athenian art was in celebration of those who had vindicated liberty with their livestwo youths again in a real incident which had however the quality of a poetic invention turning as it did on that ideal or romantic friendship which was characteristic of the greeks with something perhaps of hieratic convention yet presented as they really were as friends and admirers loved to think of them harmodius and aristogeiton stood then soon after their heroic death side by side in bronze the work of antenor in a way not to be forgotten when thirty years afterwards a foreign tyrant xerxes carried them away to persia kritios and nesistes were therefore employed for a reproduction of them which would naturally be somewhat more advanced in style in its turn this also disappeared the more curious student however would still fancy he saw the trace of itof that copy or of the original afterwards restored to athenshere or there on vase or coin but in fact the very images of the heroic youths were become but ghosts haunting the story of greek art till they found or seemed to find a body once more when not many years since an acute observer detected as he thought in a remarkable pair of statues in the museum of naples if freed from incorrect restorations and rightly set together a veritable descendant from the original work of antenor with all their truth to physical form and movement with a conscious mastery of delineation they were nevertheless in certain details in the hair for instance archaic or rather archaisticdesignedly archaic as from the hand of a workman for whom in this subject archaism the very touch of the ancient master had a sentimental or even a religious value and unmistakeably they were young assassins moving with more than fraternal unity the younger in advance of and covering the elder according to the account given by herodotus straight to their purposeagainst two wicked brothers as you remember two good friends on behalf of the dishonoured sister of one of them archaeologists have loved to adjust them tentatively with various hypotheses as to the precise manner in which they thus went together meantime they have figured plausibly as representative of attic sculpture at the end of its first period still immature indeed but with a just claim to take breath so to speak having now accomplished some stades of the journey those young heroes of athenian democracy then indicate already what place athens and attica will occupy in the supreme age of art soon to come indicate also the subject from which that age will draw the main stream of its inspirationliving youth in its exact portraiture or as idealised in various degrees under the influence of great thoughts about ityouth in its selfdenying contention towards great effects great intrinsically as at marathon or when harmodius and aristogeiton fell or magnified by the force and splendour of greek imagination with the stimulus of the national games for the most part indeed it is not with youth taxed spasmodically like that of harmodius and aristogeiton and the that was upon it that the athenian mind and heart are now busied but with youth in its voluntary labours its habitual and measured discipline labour for its own sake or in wholly friendly contest for prizes which in reality borrow all their value from the quality of the receiver we are with pindar you see in this athletic age of greek sculpture it is the period no longer of battle against a foreign foe recalling the homeric ideal nor against the tyrant at home fixing a dubious ideal for the future but of peaceful combat as a fine artpulvis olympicus anticipating the arts poetry a generation before myron and polycleitus had drawn already from the youthful combatants in the great national games the motives of those odes the bracing words of which as i said are like work in fine bronze or as pindar himself suggests in ivory and gold sung in the victors supper room or at the door of his abode or with the lyre and the pipe as they took him home in procession through the streets or commemorated the happy day or in a temple where he laid up his crown pindars songs bear witness to the pride of family or township in the physical perfection of son or citizen and his consequent success in the long or the short footrace or the footrace in armour or the pentathlon or any part of it as the poet tells ariston hydôr he declares indeed and the actual prize as we know was in itself of little or no wortha cloak in the athenian games but at the greater games a mere handful of parsley a few sprigs of pine or wild olive the prize has so to say only an intellectual or moral value yet actually pindars own verse is all of gold and wine and flowers is itself avowedly a flower or or the keynote of pindars verse is there this brilliant living youth of his day of the actual time for whom as he says he epeôn hoimon ligynthat song mingles sometimes with the splendours of a recorded ancient lineage or with the legendary greatness of a remoter past its gods and heroes patrons or ancestors it might be of the famous young man of the hour or with the glory and solemnity of the immortals themselves taking a share in mortal contests on such pretext he will tell a new story or bring to its last perfection by his manner of telling it his pregnancy and studied beauty of expression an old one the tale of castor and polydeukes the appropriate patrons of virginal yet virile youth starred and mounted he tells in all its human interest and what pindars contemporaries asked of him for the due appreciation the consciousness of it by way of song that the next generation sought by way of sculptural memorial in marble and above all as it seems in bronze the keen demand for athletic statuary the honour attached to the artist employed to make his statue at olympia or at home bear witness again to the pride with which a greek town the pathos it might be with which a family looked back to the victory of one of its members in the courts of olympia a whole population in marble and bronze gathered quicklya world of portraits out of which as the purged and perfected essence the ideal soul of them emerged the diadumenus for instance the discobolus the socalled jason of the louvre olympia was in truth as pindar says again a mother of goldcrowned contests the mother of a large offspring all over greece the enthusiasm for gymnastic for the life of the gymnasia prevailed it was a gymnastic which under the happy conditions of that time was already surely what plato pleads for already one half music mousikê a matter partly of character and of the soul of the fair proportion between soul and body of the soul with itself who can doubt it who sees and considers the still irresistible grace the contagious pleasantness of the discobolus the diadumenus and a few other precious survivals from the athletic age which immediately preceded the manhood of pheidias between the persian and the peloponnesian wars now this predominance of youth of the youthful form in art of bodily gymnastic promoting natural advantages to the utmost of the physical perfection developed thereby is a sign that essential mastery has been achieved by the artistthe power that is to say of a full and free realisation for such youth in its very essence is a matter properly within the limits of the visible the empirical world and in the presentment of it there will be no place for symbolic hint none of that reliance on the helpful imagination of the spectator the legitimate scope of which is a large one when art is dealing with religious objects with what in the fulness of its own nature is not really expressible at all in any passable representation of the greek discobolus as in any passable representation of an english cricketer there can be no successful evasion of the natural difficulties of the thing to be donethe difficulties of competing with nature itself or its maker in that marvellous combination of motion and rest of inward mechanism with the so smoothly finished surface and outlinefinished ad unguem which enfold it of the gradual development of such mastery of natural detail a veritable counterfeit of nature the veritable rhythmus of the runner for exampletwinkling heel and ivory shoulderwe have hints and traces in the historians of art one had attained the very turn and texture of the crisp locks another the very feel of the tense nerve and fullflushed vein while with another you saw the bosom of ladas expand the lips part as if for a last breath ere he reached the goal it was like a child finding little by little the use of its limbs the testimony of its senses at a definite moment with all its poetic impulse it is an age clearly of faithful observation of what we call realism alike in its iconic and heroic work alike in portraiture that is to say and in the presentment of divine or abstract types its workmen are close students now of the living form as such aim with success at an ever larger and more various expression of its details or replace a conventional statement of them by a real and lively one that it was thus is attested indirectly by the fact that they busied themselves seemingly by way of a tour de force and with no essential interest in such subject alien as it was from the pride of health which is characteristic of the gymnastic life with the expression of physical pain in philoctetes for instance the adroit the swift the strong in full and free exercise of their gifts to the delight of others and of themselves though their sculptural record has for the most part perished are specified in ancient literary notices as the sculptors favourite subjects repeated remodelled over and over again for the adornment of the actual scene of athletic success or the marketplace at home of the distant northern or sicilian town whence the prizeman had comea countless series of popular illustrations to pindars odes and if art was still to minister to the religious sense it could only be by clothing celestial spirits also as nearly as possible in the bodily semblance of the various athletic combatants whose patrons respectively they were supposed to be the age to which we are come in the story of greek art presents to us indeed only a chapter of scattered fragments of names that are little more with but surmise of their original significance and mere reasonings as to the sort of art that may have occupied what are really empty spaces two names however connect themselves gloriously with certain extant works of art copies it is true at various removes yet copies of what is still found delightful through them and by copyists who for the most part were themselves masters through the variations of the copyist the restorer the mere imitator these works are reducible to two famous original typesthe discobolus or quoitplayer of myron the beau idéal of athletic motion and the diadumenus of polycleitus as binding the fillet or crown of victory upon his head he presents the beau idéal of athletic repose and almost begins to think myron was a native of eleutherae and a pupil of ageladas of argos there is nothing more to tell by way of positive detail of this so famous artist save that the main scene of his activity was athens now become the centre of the artistic as of all other modes of life in greece multiplicasse veritatem videtur says pliny he was in fact an earnest realist or naturalist and rose to central perfection in the portraiture the idealised portraiture of athletic youth from a mastery first of all in the delineation of inferior objects of little lifeless or living things think however for a moment how winning such objects are still as presented on greek coinsthe ear of corn for instance on those of metapontum the microscopic cockleshell the dolphins on the coins of syracuse myron then passes from pleasant truth of that kind to the delineation of the worthier sorts of animal lifethe ox the dog to nothing short of illusion in the treatment of them as ancient connoisseurs would have you understand it is said that there are thirtysix extant epigrams on his brazen cow that animal has her gentle place in greek art from the siren tomb suckling her young there as the type of eternal rejuvenescence onwards to the procession of the elgin frieze where still breathing deliciously of the distant pastures she is led to the altar we feel sorry for her as we look so lifelike is the carved marble the sculptor who worked there whoever he may have been had profited doubtless by the study of myrons famous work for what purpose he made it does not appearas an architectural ornament or a votive offering perhaps only because he liked making it in hyperbolic epigram at any rate the animal breathes explaining sufficiently the point of plinys phrase regarding myroncorporum curiosus and when he came to his main business with the quoitplayer the wrestler the runner he did not for a moment forget that they too were animals young animals delighting in natural motion in free course through the yielding air over uninterrupted space according to aristotles definition of pleasure corporum tenus curiosushe was a as far as the living body is concerned pliny goes on to qualify that phrase by saying that he did not express the sensations of the mind animi sensus but just there in fact precisely in such limitation we find what authenticates myrons peculiar value in the evolution of greek art it is of the essence of the athletic prizeman involved in the very ideal of the quoitplayer the cricketer not to give expression to mind in any antagonism to or invasion of the body to mind as anything more than a function of the body whose healthful balance of functions it may so easily perturbto disavow that insidious enemy of the fairness of the bodily soul as such yet if the art of myron was but little occupied with the reasonable soul with those mental situations the expression of which though it may have a pathos and a beauty of its own is for the most part adverse to the proper expression of youth to the beauty of youth by causing it to be no longer youthful he was certainly a master of the animal or physical soul there how it is how it displays itself as illustrated for instance in the discobolus of voluntary animal motion the very soul is undoubtedly there we have but translations into marble of the original in bronze in that it was as if a blast of cool wind had congealed the metal or the living youth fixed him imperishably in that moment of rest which lies between two opposed motions the backward swing of the right arm the movement forwards on which the left foot is in the very act of starting the matter of the thing the stately bronze or marble thus rests indeed but the artistic form of it in truth scarcely more even to the eye than the rolling ball or disk may be said to rest at every moment of its coursejust metaphysically you know this mystery of combined motion and rest of rest in motion had involved of course on the part of the sculptor who had mastered its secret long and intricate consideration archaic as it is primitive still in some respects full of the primitive youth it celebrates it is in fact a learned work and suggested to a great analyst of literary style singular as it may seem the or manner in literature of the later latin writers which however he finds for its purpose yet with all its learned involution thus so oddly characterised by quintilian so entirely is this quality subordinated to the proper purpose of the discobolus as a work of art a thing to be looked at rather than to think about that it makes one exclaim still with the poet of athletesthe natural is ever bestgrant them the face of the young man as you see him in the british museum for instance with fittingly inexpressive expression is beautiful but not altogether virile the eyes the facial lines which they gather into one seem ready to follow the coming motion of the discus as those of an onlooker might be but that head does not really belong to the discobolus to be assured of this you have but to compare with that version in the british museum the most authentic of all derivations from the original preserved till lately at the palazzo massimi in rome here the vigorous head also with the face smooth enough but spare and tightly drawn over muscle and bone is sympathetic with yields itself to the concentration in the most literal sense of all besideis itself in very truth the steady centre of the discus which begins to spin as the source of will the source of the motion with which the discus is already on the wingthat and the entire form the discobolus of the massimi palace presents moreover in the hair for instance those survivals of primitive manner which would mark legitimately myrons actual pre pheidiac standpoint as they are congruous also with a certain archaic a more than merely athletic spareness of form generally delightful touches of unreality in this realist of a great time and of a sort of conventionalism that has an attraction in itself was it a portrait that one can so much as ask the question is a proof how far the master in spite of his lingering archaism is come already from the antique marbles of aegina was it the portrait of one muchadmired youth or rather the type the rectified essence of many such at the most pregnant the essential moment of the exercise of their natural powers of what they really were have we here in short the sculptor myrons reasoned memory of many a quoit player of a long flight of quoitplayers as were he here he might have given us the cricketer the passing generation of cricketers sub specie eternitatis under the eternal form of art was it in that case a commemorative or votive statue such as pausanias found scattered throughout greece was it again designed to be part only of some larger decorative scheme as some have supposed of the venus of melos or a work of genre as we say a thing intended merely to interest to gratify the taste with no further purpose in either case it may have represented some legendary quoitplayerperseus at play with acrisius fatally as one has suggested or apollo with hyacinthus as ovid describes him in a work of poetic genre and if the discobolus is after all a work of genrea work merely imitative of the detail of actual lifefor the adornment of a room in a private house it would be only one of many such produced in myrons day it would be in fact one of the pristae directly attributed to him by pliny little congruous as they may seem with the grandiose motions of his more characteristic work the pristae the sawyersa celebrated creation of the kindis supposed to have given its name to the whole class of like things no age indeed since the rudiments of art were mastered can have been without such reproductions of the pedestrian incidents of every day for the mere pleasant exercise at once of the curiosity of the spectator and the imitative instinct of the producer the terra cotta rooms of the louvre and the british museum are a proof of it one such work indeed there is delightful in itself technically exquisite most interesting by its history which properly finds its place beside the larger the fullgrown physical perfection of the discobolus one of whose alert younger brethren he may bethe spinario namely the boy drawing a thorn from his foot preserved in the so rare veritable antique bronze at rome in the museum of the capitol and well known in a host of ancient and modern reproductions there or elsewhere in rome tolerated in the general destruction of ancient sculpturelike the allowed by way of heraldic sign as in modern siena or like the equestrian figure of marcus aurelius doing duty as charlemagnelike those but like very few other works of the kind the spinario remained wellknown and in honour throughout the middle age stories like that of ladas the famous runner who died as he reached the goal in a glorious foot race of boys the subject of a famous work by myron himself were told of the halfgrown bronze lad at the capitol of necessity but fatally he must pause for a few moments in his course or the course is at length over or the breathless journey with some allimportant tidings and now not till now he thinks of resting to draw from the sole of his foot the cruel thorn driven into it as he ran in any case there he still sits for a moment for ever amid the smiling admiration of centuries in the agility in the perfect naïveté also as thus occupied of his sixteenth year to which the somewhat lengthy or attenuated structure of the limbs is conformable and then in this attenuation in the almost egyptian proportions in the shallowness of the chest and shoulders especially in the phoenician or old greek sharpness and length of profile and the long conventional wiredrawn hair of the boy arching formally over the forehead and round the neck there is something of archaism of that archaism which survives truly in myrons own work blending with the grace and power of wellnigh the maturity of greek art the blending of interests of artistic alliances is certainly delightful polycleitus the other famous name of this period and with a fame justified by work we may still study at least in its immediate derivatives had also tried his hand with success in such subjects in the astragalizontes for instance well known to antiquity in countless reproductions he had treated an incident of the everyday life of every age which plato sketches by the way myron by patience of genius had mastered the secret of the expression of movement had plucked out the very heart of its mystery polycleitus on the other hand is above all the master of rest of the expression of rest after toil in the victorious and crowned athlete diadumenus in many slightly varying forms marble versions of the original in bronze of delos the diadumenus indifferently mechanically is binding round his head a ribbon or fillet in the vaison copy at the british museum it was of silver that simple fillet is in fact a diadem a crown and he assumes it as a victor but as i said mechanically and prize in hand might be asking himself whether after all it had been worth while for the active beauty of the agonistes of which myrons art is full we have here then the passive beauty of the victor but the later incident the realisation of rest is actually in affinity with a certain earliness so to call it in the temper and work of polycleitus he is already something of a reactionary or pauses rather to enjoy to convey enjoyably to others the full savour of a particular moment in the development of his craft the moment of the perfecting of restful form before the mere consciousness of technical mastery in delineation urges forward the art of sculpture to a bewildering infinitude of motion in opposition to the ease the freedom of others his aim is by a voluntary restraint in the exercise of such technical mastery to achieve nothing less than the impeccable within certain narrow limits he still hesitates is selfexacting seems even to have checked a growing readiness of hand in the artists about him he was renowned as a graver found much to do with the chisel introducing many a fine afterthought when the roughcasting of his work was over he studied human form under such conditions as would bring out its natural features its static laws in their entirety their harmony and in an academic work so to speak no longer to be clearly identified in what may be derivations from it he claimed to have fixed the canon the common measure of perfect man yet with polycleitus certainly the measure of man was not yet but still only that of mortal youth of youth however in that scrupulous and uncontaminate purity of form which recommended itself even to the greeks as befitting messengers from the gods if such messengers should come and yet a large part of myrons contemporary fame depended on his religious workon his statue of here for instance in ivory and goldthat too doubtless expressive as appropriately to its subject as to himself of a passive beauty we see it still perhaps in the coins of argos and has not the crowned victor too in that mechanic action in his demure attitude something which reminds us of the religious significance of the greek athletic service it was a sort of worship you knowthat department of public life such worship as greece still in its superficial youth found itself best capable of at least those solemn contests began and ended with prayer and sacrifice their most honoured prizes were a kind of religiously symbolical objects the athletic life certainly breathes of abstinence of rule and the keeping under of ones self and here in the diadumenus we have one of its priests a priest of the religion whose central motive was what has been called its modest priest the socalled jason at the louvre the apoxyomenus and a certain number of others you will meet with from time to timewhatever be the age and derivation of the actual marble which reproduced for rome for africa or gaul types that can have had their first origin in one only time and placebelong at least aesthetically to this group together with the adorante of berlin winckelmanns antique favourite who with uplifted face and hands seems to be indeed in prayer looks immaculate enough to be interceding for others as to the jason of the louvre one asks at first sight of him as he stoops to make fast the sandal on his foot whether the young man can be already so marked a personage is he already the approved hero bent on some great act of his famous epopée or mere youth only again arraying itself mechanically but alert in eye and soul prompt to be roused to any great action whatever the vaguely opened lips certainly suggest the latter view if indeed the body and the head really belong to one another ah the more closely you consider the fragments of antiquity those stray letters of the old greek aesthetic alphabet the less positive will your conclusions become because less conclusive the data regarding artistic origin and purpose set here also however to the end that in a congruous atmosphere in a real perspective they may assume their full moral and aesthetic expression whatever of like spirit you may come upon in greek or any other work remembering that in england also in oxford we have still for any master of such art that may be given us subjects truly as with these so with their prototypes at olympia or at the isthmus above all perhaps in the diadumenus of polycleitus a certain melancholy is blent with the final impression we retain of them they are at play indeed in the sun but a little cloud passes over it now and then and just because of them because they are there the whole aspect of the place is chilled suddenly beyond what one could have thought possible into what seems nevertheless to be the proper and permanent light of day for though they pass on from age to age the type of what is pleasantest to look on which as type is indeed eternal it is of course but for an hour that it rests with any one of them individually assuredly they have no maladies of soul any more than of the bodyanimi sensus non expressit but if they are not yet thinking there is the capacity of thought of painful thought in them as they seem to be aware wistfully in the diadumenus of polycleitus this expression allies itself to the longdrawn facial type of his preference to be found also in another very different subject the ideal of which he fixed in greek sculpturethe wouldbe virile amazon in exquisite pain alike of body and soulthe we may be reminded that in the first mention of athletic contests in greek literaturein the twentythird book of the iliadthey form part of the funeral rites of the hero patroclus it is thus though but in the faintest degree even with the veritable prince of that world of antique bronze and marble the discobolus at rest of the vatican which might well be set where winckelmann set the adorante representing as it probably does the original of alcamenes in whom a generation after pheidias an earlier and more earnest spirit still survived although the crisply trimmed head may seem a little too small to our perhaps not quite rightful eyes we might accept him for that canon or measure of the perfect human form which polycleitus had proposed he is neither the victor at rest as with polycleitus nor the combatant already in motion as with myron but as if stepping backward from myrons precise point ofinterest and with the heavydiscusstill in the left hand he is preparing for his venture taking stand carefully on the right foot eye and mind concentre loyally entirely upon the business in hand the very finger is reckoning while he watches intent upon the cast of another as the metal glides to the goal take him to lead you forth quite out of the narrow limits of the greek world you have pure humanity there with a glowing yet restrained joy and delight in itself but without vanity and it is pure there is nothing certainly supersensual in that fair round head any more than in the long agile limbs but also no impediment natural or acquired to have achieved just that was the greeks truest claim for furtherance in the main line of human development he had been faithful we cannot help saying as we pass from that youthful company in what comparatively is perhaps littlein the culture the administration of the visible world and he merited so we might go on to sayhe merited revelation something which should solace his heart in

more complete view of the scope and purpose of mr pater in deal with the art and literature of the ancient world the essay fall into two distinct group one deal with the subject of greek mythology and

conception of the essential unity in all its manysidedness of the greek character the god understand as the of the thing of nature be not only the keynote of the and but reappear as contribute to the interpretation of the growth of greek sculpture thus though in the bibliography of his writing the two group be separate by a considerable interval there be no change of view he have already reach the

february of the present year a study of dionysus the spiritual form of fire and dew writer on mythology speak habitually of the religion of the greek in thus speak they be really use a misleading expression and should speak rather of religion each race and class of greeksthe dorian the people of the coast the fishershaving have a religion of its own conceived of the object that come near to it and be most in its thought and the result usage and idea never having come to have a precisely harmonise system after the analogy of some other religion the religion of dionysus be the religion of people who pass their life among the vine as the religion of demeter carry we back to the cornfield and farmstead of greece and place we in fancy among a primitive race in the furrow and beside the granary so the religion of dionysus carry we back to its vineyard and be a monument of the way and thought of people whose day go by beside the winepress and under the green and purple shadow and whose material happiness depend on the crop of grape for they the thought of dionysus and his circle a little olympu outside the greater cover the whole of life and be a complete religion a sacred representation or interpretation of the whole human experience modify by the special limitation the special privilege of insight or suggestion incident to their peculiar mode of existence now if the reader wish to understand what the scope of the religion of dionysus be to the greek who live in it all it represent to they by way of one clearly conceive yet complex symbol let he reflect what the loss would be if all the effect and expression draw from the imagery of the vine and the cup fall out of the whole body of exist poetry how many fascinating train of reflexion what colour and substance would therewith have be deduct from it fill as it be apart from the more aweful association of the christian ritual apart from galahad cup with all the various symbolism of the fruit of the vine that suppose loss be but an imperfect measure of all that the name of dionysus recall to the greek mind under a single imaginable form an outward body of flesh present to the sense and comprehend as its animating soul a whole world of thought surmise great and less experience the student of the comparative science of religion find in the religion of dionysus one of many mode of that primitive treeworship which grow out of some universal instinctive belief that tree and flower be indeed habitation of live spirit be find almost everywhere in the early stage of civilisation enshrine in legend or custom often graceful enough as if the delicate beauty of the object of worship have effectually take hold on the fancy of the worshipper shelleys sensitive plant show in what mist of poetical reverie such feeling may still float about a mind full of modern light the feeling we too have of a life in the green world always ready to assert its claim over our sympathetic fancy who have not at moment feel the scruple which be with we always regard animal life follow the sign of animation far still till one almost hesitate to pluck out the little soul of flower or leaf and in so graceful a faith the greek have their share what be crude and inane in it become in the atmosphere of their energetic imaginative intelligence refine and humanise the oakgrove of dodona the seat of their most venerable oracle do but perpetuate the fancy that the sound of the wind in the tree may be for certain prepared and choose ear intelligible voice they could believe in the transmigration of soul into mulberry and laurel mint and hyacinth and the dainty metamorphosis of ovid be but a fossilise form of one morsel here and there from a whole world of transformation with which their nimble fancy be perpetually play say the homeric hymn to aphrodite of the hamadryad the nymph which animate the forest tree these then be the nurse of the vine brace it with interchange of sun and shade they bathe they dance they sing song of enchantment so that those who seem oddly in love with nature and strange among their fellow be still say to be nympholepti above all they be weaver or spinster spin or weave with airy finger and subtle manycoloured thread the foliage of the tree the petal of flower the skin of the fruit the long thin stalk on which the poplar leave be set so lightly that homer compare to they in their constant motion the maid who sit spinning in the house of alcinous the nymph of naxos where the grapeskin be darkest weave for he a purple robe only the ivy be never transform be visible as natural ivy to the last press the dark outline of its leave close upon the firm white quite human flesh of the god forehead in its early form then the religion of dionysus present we with the most graceful phase of this graceful worship occupy a place between the ruder fancy of halfcivilised people concern life in flower or tree and the dreamy afterfancie of the poet of the sensitive plant he be the soul of the individual vine first the young vine at the housedoor of the newly marry for instance as the vinegrower stoop over it coax and nurse it like a pet animal or a little child afterwards the soul of the whole specie the spirit of fire and dew alive and leap in a thousand vine as the high intelligence brood more deeply over thing pursue in thought the generation of sweetness and strength in the vein of the tree the transformation of water into wine little by little note all the influence upon it of the heaven above and the earth beneath and shadow forth in each pause of the process an intervene personwhat be to we but the secret chemistry of nature be to they the mediation of live spirit so they pass on to think of dionysus not merely as the soul of the vine but of all that life in flow thing of which the vine be the symbol because its most emphatic example at delo he bear a son from whom in turn spring the three mysterious sister oeno spermo and elais who dwell in the island exercise respectively the gift of turn all thing at will into oil and corn and wine in the bacchae of euripide he give his follower by miracle honey and milk and the water gush for they from the smitten rock he come at last to have a scope equal to that of demeter a realm as wide and mysterious as her the whole productive power of the earth be in he and the explanation of its annual change as some embody their intuition of that power in corn so other in wine he be the dispenser of the earth hide wealth giver of rich through the vine as demeter through the grain and as demeter send the airy daintywheele and daintywinged spirit of triptolemus to bear her gift abroad on all wind so dionysus go on his eastern journey with its many intricate adventure on which he carry his gift to every people a little olympu outside the great i say of dionysus and his companion he be the centre of a cycle the hierarchy of the creature of water and sunlight in many degree and that fantastic system of treeworship place round he not the fondly whisper spirit of the more graceful inhabitant of woodland only the nymph of the poplar and the pine but the whole satyr circle intervene between the headship of the vine and the mere earth the gross less human spirit incorporate and make visible of the more coarse and sluggish sort of vegetable strength the fig the reed the ineradicable weedthing which will attach themselves climb about the vinepole or seek the sun between the hot stone for as dionysus the spiritual form of the vine be of the high human type so the figtree and the reed have animal soul mistakeable in the thought of a later imperfectly remember age for mere abstraction of animal nature snubnose and sweetwine and silenus the old of they all so old that he have come to have the gift of prophecy quite different from they in origin and intent but confuse with they in form be those other companion of dionysus pan and his child homespun dream of simple people and like they in the uneventful tenour of his existence he have almost no story he be but a presence the spiritual form of arcadia and the way of human life there the reflexion in sacred image or ideal of its flock and orchard and wild honey the danger of its hunter its weariness in noonday heat its child agile as the goat they tend who run in their picturesque rag across the solitary wanderer path to startle he in the unfamiliar upper place its one adornment and solace be the dance to the homely shepherd pipe cut by pan first from the sedge of the brook molpeia breathing of remote nature the sense of which be so profound in the homeric hymn to pan the pine the folding of the hill the leap stream the strange echoing and dying of sound on the height thing which the religion of dionysus lovespan join the company of the satyr amongst they they give their name to insolence and mockery and the fine sort of malice to unmeaning and ridiculous fear but the good spirit have find in they also a certain human pathos as in displace being come even near to most man in their very roughness than the noble and delicate person of the vine dubious creature halfway between the animal and human kind speculate wistfully on their being because not wholly understand themselves and their place in nature as the animal seem always to have this expression to some noticeable degree in the presence of man in the later school of attic sculpture they be treat with more and more of refinement till in some happy moment praxitele conceive a model often repeat which concentrate this sentiment of true humour concern they a model of dainty natural ease in posture but with the leg slightly cross as only lowlybre god be use to carry they and with some puzzled trouble of youth you might wish for a moment to smoothe away pucker the forehead a little between the pointed ear on which the goodly hair of his animal strength grow low little by little the sign of brute nature be subordinate or disappear and at last robetta a humble italian engraver of the fifteenth century enter into the greek fancy because it belong to all age have express it in its most exquisite form in a design of cere and her child of whom their mother be no long afraid as in the homeric hymn to pan the puck nose have grow delicate so that with plato infatuate lover you may call they winsome if you please and no one would wish those hairy little shank away with which one of the small pan walk at her side grasp her skirt stoutly while the other the sick or weary one ride in the arm of cere herself who in graceful italian dress and deck airily with fruit and corn step across a country of cut sheaf press it closely to she with a child peevish trouble in its face and its small goatleg and tiny hoof fold over together precisely after the manner of a little child there be one element in the conception of dionysus which his connexion with the satyrs marsyas be one of they and with pan from whom the flute pass to all the shepherd of theocritus alike illustrate his interest namely in one of the great specie of music one form of that wilder vegetation of which the satyr race be the soul make visible be the reed which the creature pluck and trim into musical pipe and as apollo inspire and rule over all the music of string so dionysus inspire and rule over all the music of the reed the waterplant in which the idea of water and of vegetable life be bring close together natural property therefore of the spirit of life in the green sap i say that the religion of dionysus be for those who live in it a complete religion a complete sacred representation and interpretation of the whole of life and as in his relation to the vine he fill for they the place of demeter be the life of the earth through the grape as she through the grain so in this other phase of his be in his relation to the reed he fill for they the place of apollo he be the inherent cause of music and poetry he inspire he explain the phenomena of enthusiasm as distinguish by plato in the phaedrus the secret of possession by a high and more energetic spirit than one own the gift of selfrevelation of pass out of oneself through word tone gesture a wing dionysus venerate at amyclae be perhaps mean to represent he thus as the god of enthusiasm of the rise up on those spiritual wing of which also we hear something in the phaedrus of plato the artist of the renaissance occupy themselves much with the person and the story of dionysus and michelangelo in a work still remain in florence in which he essay with success to produce a thing which should pass with the critic for a piece of ancient sculpture have represent he in the fulness as it seem of this enthusiasm an image of delighted entire surrender to transport dream and this be no subtle afterthought of a later age but true to certain fine movement of old greek sentiment though it may seem to have wait for the hand of michelangelo before it attain complete realisation the head of ion lean as they recline at the banquet on the shoulder of charmide he mutter in his sleep of thing see therein but awake as the fluteplayer enter whom charmide have hire for his birthday supper the soul of callia who sit on the other side of charmides flash out he counterfeit with lifelike gesture the personal trick of friend or foe or the thing he could never utter before he find word for now the secret of life be on his lip it be in this loosening of the lip and heart strictly that dionysus be the deliverer eleutherio and of such enthusiasm or ecstasy be in a certain sense an old patron than apollo himself even at delphi the centre of greek inspiration and of the religion of apollo his claim always maintain itself and sign be not want that apollo be but a later comer there there under his later reign hard by the golden image of apollo himself near the sacred tripod on which the pythia sit to prophesy be to be see a strange objecta sort of coffin or cinerary urn with the inscription the pediment of the great temple be divide between themapollo with the nine muse on that side dionysus with perhaps three time three grace on this a third of the whole year be hold sacred to he the four winter month be the month of dionysus and in the shrine of apollo itself he be worship with almost equal devotion the religion of dionysus take we back then into that old greek life of the vineyard as we see it on many paint vase with much there as we should find it now as we see it in bennozzo gozzolis mediaeval fresco of the invention of wine in the campo santo at pisa the family of noah present among all the circumstance of a tuscan vineyard around the press from which the first wine be flow a paint idyll with its vintage colour still opulent in decay and not without its solemn touch of biblical symbolism for difference we detect in that primitive life and under that greek sky a nimbler play of fancy lightly and unsuspiciously invest all thing with personal aspect and incident and a certain mystical apprehension now almost departed of unseen power beyond the material veil of thing correspond to the exceptional vigour and variety of the greek organisation this peasant life lie in unhistoric time behind the definite form with which poetry and a refined priesthood afterwards clothe the religion of dionysus and the mere scenery and circumstance of the vineyard have determine many thing in its development the noise of the vineyard still sound in some of his epithet perhaps in his bestknown nameiacchus bacchus the mask suspend on base or cornice so familiar an ornament in later greek architecture be the little face hang from the vine and move in the wind to scare the bird that garland of ivy the aesthetic value of which be so great in the later imagery of dionysus and his descendant the leave of which float from his hair become so noble in the hand of titian and tintoret be actually wear on the head for coolness his early and most sacred image be work in the wood of the vine the people of the vineyard have their feast the little or country dionysia which still live on side by side with the great ceremony of a later time celebrate in december the time of the storing of the new wine it be then that the potter fair come calpis and amphora together with lamp against the winter lay out in order for the choice of buyer for keramus the greek vase be a son of dionysus of wine and of athene who teach man all serviceable and decorative art then the goat be kill and its blood pour out at the root of the vine and dionysus literally drink the blood of goat and be greek with quick and mobile sympathy deisidaimone or rather some among they remember those depart since last year add yet a little more and a little wine and water for the dead also brood how the sense of these thing might pass below the root to spirit hungry and thirsty perhaps in their shadowy home but the gaiety that gaiety which aristophane in the acharnian have depict with so many vivid touch as a thing of which civil war have deprive the village of attica preponderate over the grave the travel country show come round with its puppet even the slave have their holiday the mirth become excessive they hide their face under grotesque mask of bark or stain they with winelee or potter crimson even like the old rude idol paint red and carry in midnight procession such rough symbol of the productive force of nature as the woman and child have well not look upon which will be frown upon and refine themselves or disappear in the feast of cultivate athen of the whole story of dionysus it be the episode of his marriage with ariadne about which ancient art concern itself oftenest and with most effect here although the antiquarian may still detect circumstance which link the person and incident of the legend with the mystical life of the earth as symbol of its annual change yet the merely human interest of the story have prevail over its early significance the spiritual form of fire and dew have become a romantic lover and as a story of romantic love full perhaps of all the motive of classic legend of the pride of life it survive with undiminished interest to a late world two of the great master of italian painting having pour their whole power into it titian with great space of ingathere shore and mountain and solemn foliage and fiery animal life tintoret with profounder luxury of delight in the nearness to each other and imminent embrace of glorious bodily presence and both alike with consummate beauty of physical form hardly less humanise be the theban legend of dionysus the legend of his birth from semele which out of the entire body of tradition concern he be accept as central by the athenian imagination for the people of attica he come from boeotia a country of northern marsh and mist but from whose sombre black marble town come also the vine the musical reed cut from its sedge and the worship of the grace always so closely connect with the religion of dionysus say sophocle his mother be the daughter of cadmus himself mark out by many curious circumstance as the close kinsman of the earth to which he all but return at last as the serpent in his old age attest some close sense linger there of the affinity of man with the dust from whence he come semele an old greek word as it seem for the surface of the earth the daughter of cadmus belove by zeus desire to see her lover in the glory with which he be see by the immortal hera he appear to she in lightning but the mortal may not behold he and live semele give premature birth to the child dionysus whom to preserve it from the jealousy of hera zeus hide in a part of his thigh the child return into the loin of its father whence in due time it be bear again yet in this fantastic story hardly less than in the legend of ariadne the story of dionysus have become a story of human person with human fortune and even more intimately human appeal to sympathy so that euripide preeminent as a poet of pathos find in it a subject altogether to his mind all the interest now turn on the development of its point of moral or sentimental significance the love of the immortal for the mortal the presumption of the daughter of man who desire to see the divine form as it be on the fact that not without loss of sight or life itself can man look upon it the travail of nature have be transform into the pang of the human mother and the poet dwell much on the pathetic incident of death in childbirth make dionysus as callimachus call he a seven month child cast out among its enemy motherless and as a consequence of this human interest the legend attach itself as in an actual history to definite sacred object and place the venerable relic of the wooden image which fall into the chamber of semele with the lightningflash and which the piety of a later age cover with plate of brass the ivy fountain near thebe the water of which be so wonderfully bright and sweet to drink where the nymph bathe the newborn child the grave of semele in a sacred enclosure grow with ancient vine where some volcanic heat or flame be perhaps actually traceable near the lightningstruck ruin of her suppose abode yet though the mystical body of the earth be forget in the human anguish of the mother of dionysus the sense of his essence of fire and dew still linger in his most sacred name as the son of semele dithyrambus we speak of a certain wild music in word or rhythm as dithyrambic like the dithyrambus that be the wild choralsinging of the worshipper of dionysus but dithyrambus seem to have be in the first instance the name not of the hymn but of the god to whom the hymn be sing and through a tangle of curious etymological speculation as to the precise derivation of this name one thing seem clearly visible that it commemorate namely the double birth of the vinegod that he be bear once and again his birth first of fire and afterwards of dew the two danger that beset he his victory over two enemy the capricious excessive heat and cold of spring he be pyrigenês then fireborn the son of lightning lightning be to light as regard concentration what wine be to the other strength of the earth and who that have rest a hand on the glitter silex of a vineyard slope in august where the pale globe of sweetness be lie do not feel this it be out of the bitter salt of a smitten volcanic soil that it come up with the most curious virtue the mother faint and be parch up by the heat which bring the child to the birth and it pierce through a wonder of freshness draw its everlasting green and typical coolness out of the midst of the ashe its own stem become at last like a tangle mass of torture metal in thinking of dionysus then as fireborn the greek apprehend and embody the sentiment the poetry of all tender thing which grow out of a hard soil or in any sense blossom before the leaf like the little mezereonplant of english garden with its palepurple winescente flower upon the leafless twig in february or like the almondtree of tuscany or aaron rod that bud or the staff in the hand of the pope when tannhäuser repentance be accept and his second birth be of the dew the fire of which he be bear would destroy he in his turn as it wither up his mother a second danger come from this the plant be protect by the influence of the cool cloud the low part of his father the sky in which it be wrap and hide and of which it be bear again its second mother be in some version of the legend hyéthe dew the nursery where zeus place it to be bring up be a cave in mount nysa seek by a misdirect ingenuity in many land but really like the place of the carrying away of persephone a place of fantasy the oozy place of spring in the hollow of the hillside nowhere and everywhere where the vine be the nymph of the tree overshadow it from above the nymph of the spring sustain it from belowthe hyade those first leap maenad who as the spring become raincloud go up to heaven among the star and descend again as dew or shower upon it so that the religion of dionysus connect itself not with treeworship only but also with ancient waterworship the worship of the spiritual form of spring and stream to escape from his enemy dionysus leap into the sea the original of all rain and spring whence in early summer the woman of elis and argo be will not to call he with the singing of a hymn and again in thus commemorate dionysus as bear of the dew the greek apprehend and embody the sentiment the poetry of water for not the heat only but its solacethe freshness of the cup this too be feel by those people of the vineyard whom the prophet melampus have teach to mix always their wine with water and with whom the watering of the vine become a religious ceremony the very dead as they think drink of and refresh by the stream and who that have ever feel the heat of a southern country do not know this poetry the motive of the loveliest of all the work attribute to giorgione the fête champêtre in the louvre the intense sensation the subtle and farreache symbolism which in these place cle about the touch and sound and sight of it think of the darkness of the well in the breathless court with the delicate ring of fern keep alive just within the opening of the sound of the fresh water flow through the wooden pipe into the house of venice on summer morning of the cry acqua frésca at padua or verona when the people run to buy what they prize in its rare purity more than wine bring pleasure so full of exquisite appeal to the imagination that in these street the very beggar one think might exhaust all the philosophy of the epicurean out of all these fancy come the vinegrower god the spiritual form of fire and dew beyond the famous representation of dionysus in later art and poetrythe bacchanal of euripide the statuary of the school of praxitelesa multitude of literary allusion and local custom carry we back to this world of vision unchecke by positive knowledge in which the myth be beget among a primitive people as they wonder over the life of the thing their hand help forward till it become for they a kind of spirit and their culture of it a kind of worship dionysus as we see he in art and poetry be the project expression of the way and dream of this primitive people brood over and harmonise by the energetic greek imagination the religious imagination of the greek be precisely a unifying or identify power bring together thing naturally asunder make as it be for the human body a soul of water for the human soul a body of flower weld into something like the identity of a human personality the whole range of man experience of a give object or series of objectsall their outward quality and the visible fact regard themall the hide ordinance by which those fact and quality hold of unseen force and have their root in purely visionary place dionysus come later than the other god to the centre of greek life and as a consequence of this he be present to we in an early stage of development than they that element of natural fact which be the original essence of all mythology be more unmistakeably impressed upon we here than in other myth not the least interesting point in the study of he be that he illustrate very clearly not only the early but also a certain later influence of this element of natural fact in the development of the god of greece for the physical sense latent in it be the clue not merely to the original signification of the incident of the divine story but also to the source of the peculiar imaginative expression which its person subsequently retain in the form of the high greek sculpture and this lead i to some general thought on the relation of greek sculpture to mythology which may help to explain what the function of the imagination in greek sculpture really be in its handling of divine person that zeus be in early original primitive intention the open sky across which the thunder sometimes sound and from which the rain descendsis a fact which not only explain the various story relate concern he but determine also the expression which he retain in the work of pheidia so far as it be possible to recall it long after the growth of those later story have obscure for the mind of his worshipper his primary signification if man feel as arrian tell we that it be a calamity to die without having see the zeus of olympia that be because they experience the impress there of that which the eye and the whole being of man love to find above he and the genius of pheidia have avail to shed upon the gold and ivory of the physical form the blandness the breadth the smile of the open sky the mild heat of it still come and go in the face of the father of all the child of sunshine and shower as if one of the great white cloud have compose itself into it and look down upon they thus out of the midsummer noonday so that those thing might be feel as warm and fresh and blue by the young and the old the weak and the strong who come to sun themselves in the god presence as procession and hymn roll on in the fragrant and tranquil court of the great olympian temple while all the time those people consciously apprehend in the carve image of zeus none but the personal and really human characteristic or think again of the zeus of dodona the oracle of dodona with its dim grove of oak and sound instrument of brass to husband the faint whisper in the leave be but a great consecration of that sense of a mysterious will of which people still feel or seem to feel the expression in the motion of the wind as it come and go and which make it indeed seem almost more than a mere symbol of the spirit within we for zeus be indeed the god of the wind also aeolus their socalled god be only his mortal minister as having come by long study of they through sign in the fire and the like to have a certain communicable skill regard they in relation to practical use now suppose a greek sculptor to have propose to himself to present to his worshipper the image of this zeus of dodona who be in the tree and on the current of the air then if he have be a really imaginative sculptor work as pheidia work the very soul of those move sonorous creature would have pass through his hand into the eye and hair of the image as they can actually pass into the visible expression of those who have drunk deeply of they as we may notice sometimes in our walk on mountain or shore victory againnikéassociate so often with zeuson the top of his staff on the foot of his throne on the palm of his extended hand mean originally mythologic science tell we only the great victory of the sky the triumph of morning over darkness but that physical morning of her origin have its ministry to the later aesthetic sense also for if niké when she appear in company with the mortal and wholly fleshly hero in whose chariot she stand to guide the horse or whom she crown with her garland of parsley or bay or whose name she write on a shield be imaginatively conceive it be because the old skyey influence be still not quite suppress in her clearset eye and the dew of the morning still cling to her wing and her float hair the office of the imagination then in greek sculpture in its handling of divine person be thus to condense the impression of natural thing into human form to retain that early mystical sense of water or wind or light in the moulding of eye and brow to arrest it or rather perhaps to set it free there as human expression the body of man indeed be for the greek still the genuine work of prometheus its connexion with earth and air assert in many a legend not shade down as with we through innumerable stage of descent but direct and immediate in precise contrast to our physical theory of our life which never seem to fade dream over it as we will out of the light of common day the oracle with their message to human intelligence from bird and spring of water or vapour of the earth be a witness to that connexion their story go back as they believe with unbroken continuity and in the very place where their later life be live to a past stretching beyond yet continuous with actual memory in which heaven and earth mingle to those who be son and daughter of star and stream and dew to an ancestry of grander man and woman actually clothe in or incorporate with the quality and influence of those object and we can hardly overestimate the influence on the greek imagination of this mythical connexion with the natural world at not so remote a date and of the solemnise power exercise thereby over their thought in this intensely poetical situation the historical greek the athenian of the age of pericle find themselves it be as if the actual road on which man daily walk go up and on into a visible wonderland with such habitual impression concern the body the physical nature of man the greek sculptor in his later day still free in imagination through the linger influence of those early dream may have more easily infuse into human form the sense of sun or lightning or cloud to which it be so closely akin the spiritual flesh ally itself happily to mystical meaning and readily express seemingly unspeakable quality but the human form be a limit influence also and in proportion as art impress human form in sculpture or in the drama on the vaguer conception of the greek mind there be danger of an escape from they of the free spirit of air and light and sky hence all through the history of greek art there be a struggle a streben as the germans say between the palpable and limited human form and the float essence it be to contain on the one hand be the teem still fluid world of old belief as we see it reflect in the somewhat formless theogony of hesiod a world the titanic vastness of which be congruous with a certain sublimity of speech when he have to speak for instance of motion or space as the greek language itself have a primitive copiousness and energy of word for wind fire water cold soundatteste a deep susceptibility to the impression of those thingsyet with edge most often melt into each other on the other hand there be that limit control tendency identify with the dorian influence in the history of the greek mind the spirit of a severe and wholly selfconscious intelligence bend on impress everywhere in the product of the imagination the definite perfectly conceivable human form as the only worthy subject of art less in sympathy with the mystical genealogy of hesiod than with the hero of homer end in the entirely humanise religion of apollo the clearly understand humanity of the old greek warrior in the marble of aegina the representation of man as he be or might be become the aim of sculpture and the achievement of this the subject of its whole history one early carver have open the eye another the lip a third have give motion to the foot in various way in spite of the retention of archaic idol the genuine human expression have come with the truthfulness of life itself these two tendency then meet and struggle and be harmonise in the supreme imagination of pheidia in sculptureof aeschylus in the drama hence a series of wondrous personality of which the greek imagination become the dwellingplace beautiful perfectly understand human outline embody a strange delightful linger sense of cloud and water and sun such a world the world of really imaginative greek sculpture we still see reflect in many a humble vase or batter coin in bacchante and centaur and amazon evolve out of that with most command in the consummate fragment of the parthenon not indeed so that he who run may read the gift of greek sculpture be always delicate and ask much of the receiver but yet visible and a pledge to we of creative power as to the worshipper of the presence which without that material pledge have but vaguely haunt the field and grove this then be what the greek imagination do for men sense and experience of natural force in athene in zeus in poseidon for men sense and experience of their own bodily qualitiesswiftness energy power of concentrate sight and hand and foot on a momentary physical actin the close hair the chastened muscle the perfectly poise attention of the quoitplayer for men sense again of ethical qualitiesrestless idealism inward vision power of presence through that vision in scene behind the experience of ordinary menin the idealise alexander to illustrate this function of the imagination as especially develop in greek art we may reflect on what happen with we in the use of certain name as express summarily this name for you and that for mehelen gretchen marya hundred association train of sound form impression remember in all sort of degree which through a very wide and full experience they have the power of bring with they in which respect such name be but reveal instance of the whole significance power and use of language in general wellthe mythical conception project at last in drama or sculpture be the name the instrument of the identification of the give matterof its unity in variety its outline or definition in mystery its spiritual form to use again the expression i have borrow from william blakeform with hand and lip and open eyelidsspiritual as convey to we in that the soul of rain or of a greek river or of swiftness or purity to illustrate this think what the effect would be if you could associate by some trick of memory a certain group of natural object in all their varied perspective their change of colour and tone in vary light and shade with the being and image of an actual person you travel through a country of clear river and wide meadow or of high windy place or of lowly grass and willow or of the lady of the lake and all the complex impression of these object wound themselves as a second animate body new and more subtle around the person of some one leave there so that they no long come to recollection apart from each other now try to conceive the image of an actual person in whom somehow all those impression of the vine and its fruit as the high type of the life of the green sap have become incorporateall the scent and colour of its flower and fruit and something of its curl foliage the chance of its growth the enthusiasm the easy flow of more choice expression as its juice mount within one for the image be eloquent too in word gesture and glancing of the eye which seem to be inform by some soul of the vine within it as wordsworth say beauty bear of murmur sound shall pass into her face so conceive an image into which the beauty of the vine have pass and you have the idea of dionysus as he appear entirely fashion at last by central greek poetry and art and be consecrate in the oinophoria and the anthestêria the great festival of the winepress and the flower the word wine and with it the germ of the myth of dionysus be old than the separation of the indogermanic race yet with the people of athens dionysus count as the young of the god he be also the son of a mortal dead in childbirth and seem always to have exercise the charm of the late bear in a sort of allowable fondness through the finespun speculation of modern ethnologist and grammarian note the change in the letter of his name and catch at the slight historical record of his worship we may trace his come from phrygia the birthplace of the more mystical element of greek religion over the mountain of thrace on the height of pangaeus he leave an oracle with a perpetually burn fire famous down to the time of augustus who reverently visit it southward still over the hill of parnassus which remain for the inspire woman of boeotia the centre of his presence he come to thebe and the family of cadmus from boeotia he pass to attica to the village first at last to athen at an assignable date under peisistratus out of the country into the town to this stage of his townlife that dionysus of already belong it be to the athenian of the town to urbane young man sit together at the banquet that those expression of a sudden eloquence come of the loosen utterance and fine speech its colour and imagery dionysus then have enter athen to become urbane like they to walk along the marble street in frequent procession in the person of noble youth like those who at the oschophoria bear the branch of the vine from his temple to the temple of athene of the parasol or of beautiful slave to contribute through the art to the adornment of life yet perhaps also in part to weaken it relax ancient austerity gradually his rough country feast will be outdo by the feast of the town and as comedy arise out of those so these will give rise to tragedy for his entrance upon this new stage of his career his come into the town be from the first tinge with melancholy as if in enter the town he have put off his country peace the other olympian be above sorrow dionysus like a strenuous mortal hero like hercule or perseus have his alternation of joy and sorrow of struggle and hardwon triumph it be out of the sorrow of dionysus thenof dionysus in winterthat all greek tragedy grow out of the song of the sorrow of dionysus sing at his winter feast by the chorus of satyr singer clothe in goatskin in memory of his rural life one and another of whom from time to time step out of the company to emphasise and develope this or that circumstance of the story and so the song become dramatic he will soon forget that early country life or remember it but as the dreamy background of his later existence he will become as always in later art and poetry of dazzle whiteness no long dark with the air and sun but like one eskiatrofêkôsbrought up under the shade of eastern portico or pavilion or in the light that have only reach he soften through the texture of green leave honeypale like the delicate people of the city like the flesh of woman as those old vasepainter conceive of it who leave their hand and face untouched with the pencil on the white clay the ruddy god of the vineyard stain with winelee or coarser colour will hardly recognise his double in the white graceful mournful figure weep chastened lifting up his arm in yearn affection towards his latefound mother as we see he on a famous etruscan mirror only in thinking of this early tragedy of these town feast and of the entrance of dionysus into athen you must suppose not the later athen which be oftenest in our thought the athen of pericle and pheidia but that little early athen of peisistratus which the persian destroy which some of we perhaps would rather have see in its early simplicity than the great one when the old image of the god carve probably out of the stock of an enormous vine have just come from the village of eleutherae to his first temple in the lenaeumthe quarter of the winepress near the limnaethe marshy place which in athens represent the cave of nysa its little building on the hilltop still with steep rocky way crowd round the ancient temple of erechtheus and the grave of cecrop with the old miraculous olivetree still grow there and the old snake of athene polia still alive somewhere in the temple court the artist of the italian renaissance have treat dionysus many time and with great effect but always in his joy as an embodiment of that glory of nature to which the renaissance be a return but in an early engraving of mocetto there be for once a dionysus treat differently the cold light of the background display a barren hill the bridge and tower of an italian town and quiet water in the foreground at the root of a vine dionysus be sit in a posture of statuesque weariness the leave of the vine be grandly draw and wreathe heavily round the head of the god suggest the notion of his incorporation into it the right hand hold a great vessel languidly and indifferently let the stream of wine flow along the earth while the left support the forehead shadow heavily a face comely but full of an expression of painful brood one know not how far one may really be from the mind of the old italian engraver in gather from his design this impression of a melancholy and sorrow dionysus but modern motive be clear and in a bacchus by a young hebrew painter in the exhibition of the royal academy of there be a complete and very fascinating realisation of such a motive the god of the bitterness of wine the seawater of the lesbian grape become somewhat brackish in the cup touch by the sentiment of this subtler melancholy dionysus we may ask whether anything similar in feeling be to be actually find in the range of greek ideashad some antitype of this fascinating figure any place in greek religion yes in a certain dark side of the double god of nature obscure behind the bright episode of thebe and naxos but never quite forget something corresponding to this deeply more refined idea really existedthe conception of dionysus zagreus an image which have leave indeed but little effect in greek art and poetry which criticism have to put patiently together out of late scatter hint in various writer but which be yet discernible clearly enough to show that it really visit certain greek mind here and there and discernible not as a late after thought but as a tradition really primitive and harmonious with the original motive of the idea of dionysus in its potential though unrealise scope it be perhaps the subtle dream in greek religious poetry and be at least part of the complete physiognomy of dionysus as it actually reveal itself to the modern student after a complete survey the whole compass of the idea of dionysus a dual god of both summer and winter become ultimately as we see almost identical with that of demeter the phrygian believe that the god sleep in winter and awoke in summer and celebrate his waking and sleeping or that he be bind and imprison in winter and unbound in spring we see how in elis and at argo the woman call he out of the sea with the singing of hymn in early spring and a beautiful ceremony in the temple at delphi which as we know he share with apollo describe by plutarch represent his mystical resurrection yearly about the time of the short day just as the light begin to increase and while hope be still tremulously string the priestess of dionysus be will not to assemble with many light at his shrine and there with song and dance awake the newborn child after his wintry sleep wave in a sacred cradle like the great basket use for winnow corn a symbolical image or perhaps a real infant he be twofold thena döppelganger like persephone he belong to two world and have much in common with she and a full share of those dark possibility which even apart from the story of the rape belong to she he be a chthonian god and like all the child of the earth have an element of sadness like hade himself he be hollow and devouring an eater of mans fleshsarcophagusthe grave which consume unaware the ivorywhite shoulder of pelop and you have no soon catch a glimpse of this image than a certain perceptible shadow come creep over the whole story for in effect we have see glimpse of the sorrow dionysus all along part of the interest of the theban legend of his birth be that he come of the marriage of a god with a mortal woman and from the first like merely mortal hero he fall within the sphere of human chance at first indeed the melancholy settle round the person of his mother dead in childbirth and ignorant of the glory of her son in shame accord to euripide punish as her own sister allege for impiety the death of semele be a sort of ideal or type of this peculiar claim on human pity as the descent of persephone into hade of all human pity over the early death of woman accordingly his triumph be now consummate he descend into hade through the unfathomable alcyonian lake accord to the most central version of the legend to bring she up from thence and that herme the shadowy conductor of soul be constantly associate with dionysus in the story of his early life be not without significance in this connexion as in delphi the winter month be sacred to he so in athens his feast all fall within the four month on this and the other side of the short day as persephone spend those four monthsa third part of the yearin hade son or brother of persephone he actually become at last in confused half develop tradition and even have his place with his dark sister in the eleusinian mystery as iacchus where on the sixth day of the feast in the great procession from athen to eleusis we may still realise his image move up and down above the head of the vast multitude as he go beside to the temple of demeter amid the light of torch at noonday but it be among the mountain of thrace that this gloomy element in the being of dionysus have take the strong hold as in the sunny village of attica the cheerful element of his religion have be develop so in those wilder northern region people continue to brood over its dark side and hence a current of gloomy legend descend into greece the subject of the bacchanal of euripide be the infatuate opposition of pentheus king of thebe to dionysus and his religion his cruelty to the god whom he shut up in prison and who appear on the stage with his delicate limb cruelly bind but who be finally triumphant pentheus the man of grief be tear to piece by his own mother in the judicial madness send upon she by the god in this play euripide have only take one of many version of the same story in all of which dionysus be victorious his enemy be tear to piece by the sacred woman or by wild horse or dog or the fang of cold or the maenad ambrosia whom he be suppose to pursue for purpose of lust suddenly become a vine and bind he down to the earth inextricably in her serpentine coil in all these instance then dionysus punish his enemy by repay they in kind but a deep vein of poetry pause at the sorrow and in the conflict do not too soon anticipate the final triumph it be dionysus himself who exhaust these suffering hence in many formsreflexe of all the various phase of his wintry existencethe image of dionysus zagreus the hunterof dionysus in winterstorme wildly on the dark thracian hill from which like are and borea he originally descend into greece the thought of the hunter concentrate into itself all men foreboding over the departure of the year at its rich and the death of all sweet thing in the longcontinue cold when the sick and the old and little child gaze out morning after morning on the dun sky can hardly believe in the return any more of a bright day or he be connect with the fear the danger and hardship of the hunter himself lose or slay sometimes far from home in the dense wood of the mountain as he seek his meat so ardently become in his chase almost akin to the wild beaststo the wolf who come before we in the name of lycurgus one of his bitter enemiesand a phase therefore of his own personality in the true intention of the myth this transformation this image of the beautiful soft creature become an enemy of human kind put off himself in his madness wrong by his own fierce hunger and thirst and haunt with terrible sound the high thracian farm be the most tragic note of the whole picture and link he on to one of the gloomy creation of late romance the werewolf the belief in which still linger in greece as in france where it seem to become incorporate in the darkest of all romantic history that of gille de retz and now we see why the tradition of human sacrifice linger on in greece in connexion with dionysus as a thing of actual detail and not remote so that dionysius of halicarnassus count it among the horror of greek religion that the sacred woman of dionysus eat in mystical ceremony raw flesh and drank blood be a fact often mention and commemorate as it seem the actual sacrifice of a fair boy deliberately tear to piece fade at last into a symbolical offering at delphi the wolf be preserve for he on the principle by which venus love the dove and hera peacock and there be place in which after the sacrifice of a kid to he a curious mimic pursuit of the priest who have offer it represent the still survive horror of one who have throw a child to the wolf the three daughter of minyas devote themselves to his worship they cast lot and one of they offer her own tender infant to be tear by the three like a roe then the other woman pursue they and they be turn into bat or moth or other creature of the night and fable be endorse by history plutarch tell we how before the battle of salamis with the assent of themistocle three persian captive youth be offer to dionysus the devourer as then some embody their fear of winter in persephone other embody they in dionysus a devouring god whose sinister side be illustrate in the dark and shameful secret society describe by livy in which his worship end at rome afterwards abolish by solemn act of the senate he become a new aidoneus a hunter of men soul like he to be appease only by costly sacrifice and then dionysus recover from his midwinter madness how intensely these people conceive the spring it be that triumphant dionysus cure of his great malady and sane in the clear light of the long day whom euripide in the bacchanal set before we as still essentially the hunter zagreus though he keep the red stream and tear flesh away from the delicate body of the god in his long vesture of white and gold and fragrant with eastern odour of this i hope to speak in another paper let i conclude this by one phase more of religious custom if dionysus like persephone have his gloomy side like she he have also a peculiar message for a certain number of refined mind seek in the later day of greek religion such modification of the old legend as may minister to ethical culture to the perfecting of the moral nature a type of second birth from first to last he open in his series of annual change for mind on the lookout for it the hope of a possible analogy between the resurrection of nature and something else as yet unrealise reserve for human soul and the beautiful weeping creature vex by the wind suffer tear to piece and rejuvenescent again at last

certainty fact and surmise be reflect and concentrate for its production as if on the surface of a mirror such concrete character however greek poet or sculptor from time to time impress on the vague

might retain a permanent place in men imagination here in what euripide really say in what we actually see on the stage as we read his play we be deal with a single real object not with uncertain

accompaniment of music and light and dance rational and moderate athenian as we may gather from some admission of euripide himself somewhat despise all that while those who be more fanatical forsook the home celebration and go on pilgrimage from attica to cithaeron or delphi but at pella person of high birth take part in the exercise and at a later period we read in plutarch how olympia the mother of alexander the great be devoted to this enthusiastic worship although in one of botticellis picture the angel dance very sweetly and may represent many circumstance actually record in the hebrew scripture yet we hardly understand the dance as a religious ceremony the bare mention of it set we think on some fundamental difference between the pagan religion and our own it be to such

under a cloud her own sister sin against natural affection pitiless over her pathetic death and find in it only a judgment upon the impiety with which having shame herself with some mortal lover she have throw the blame of her sin upon zeus have so far triumph over her the true and glorious version of her story live only in the subdued memory of the two aged man teiresias the prophet and her father cadmu apt now to let thing go loosely by who have delegate his royal power to pentheus the son of one of those sistersa hotheade and impious youth so thing have pass at thebe and now a strange circumstance have happen an odd sickness have fall upon the woman dionysus have send the sting of his enthusiasm upon they and have push it to a sort of madness a madness which imitate the true thiasus force to have the form without the profit of his worship the whole female population leave distaff and spindle and head by the three princess have desert the town and be lie encamp on the bare

the central figure they say and we may think we see the green festoon of the vine drop quickly from footplace to footplace down the broken hillside in spring when like the bacchanal all who can wander

semele and zeus then amid the short break rapturous cry of the woman of the chorus proclaim he master the noise of an earthquake pass slowly the pillar of the palace be see wave to and fro while the strange memorial fire from the tomb of semele blaze up and envelop the whole building the terrified woman fle themselves on the ground and then at last as the place be shake open dionysus be see step out from among the totter masse of the mimic palace bid they arise and fear not but just here come a long pause in the action of the play in which we must listen to a messenger newly arrive from the glen to tell we what he have see there among the maenad the singular somewhat sinister beauty of this speech and a similar one subsequenta fair description of morning on the mountaintop with the bacchic woman sleep which turn suddenly to a hard coarse picture of animal cruelly renti one of the special curiosity which distinguish this play and as it be wholly narrative i shall give it in english prose abbreviate here and there some detail which seem to have but a metrical value and thy mother when she hear the lowing of the kine stand up in the midst of they and cry to they to shake off sleep and they cast slumber from their eye start upright a marvel of beauty and order young and old and maiden yet unmarried and first they let fall their hair upon their shoulder and those whose cincture be unbound recompose the spot fawnskin knot they about with snake which rise and lick they on the chin some lately mother who with breast still swell have leave their babe behind nurse in

with their fingertip gather from it abundance of milk and from the ivy of the mystic wand stream of honey distil verily hadst thou see these thing thou wouldst have worship whom now thou revil a grotesque scene follow in which the humour we note on see those two old man diffidently set forth in chaplet and fawn skin deepen into a profound tragic irony pentheus be determined to go out in arm against the bacchanal and put they to death when a sudden desire seize he to witness they in their encampment upon the mountain dionysus whom he still suppose to be but a prophet or messenger of the god engage to conduct he thither and for great security among the dangerous woman propose that he shall disguise himself in female attire as pentheus go within for that purpose he linger for a moment behind he and in prophetic speech declare the approach endthe victim have fall into the net and he go in to assist at the toilet to array he in the ornament which he will carry to hade destroy by his own mother hand it be characteristic of euripidespart of his fine tact and subtletyto relieve and justify what seem tedious or constrained or merely terrible and grotesque by a suddenly suggest trait of homely pathos or a glimpse of natural beauty or a morsel of form or colour seemingly take directly from picture or sculpture so here in this fantastic scene our thought be change in a moment by the singing of the chorus and divert for a while to the darkhaire tress of the wood the breath of the riverside be upon we beside it a fawn escape from the hunter net be fly swiftly in its joy like it the maenad rush along and we see the little head throw back upon the neck in deep aspiration to drink in the dew meantime pentheus have assume his disguise and come forth trick up with false hair and the dress of a bacchanal but still with some misgiving at the thought of going thus attire through the street of thebe and with many laughable readjustment of the unwonted article of clothing and with the womans dress his madness be close fast round he just before in the palace terrify at the noise of the earthquake he have draw sword upon a mere fantastic appearance and pierce only the empty air now he begin to see the sun double and thebe with all its tower repeat while his conductor seem to he transform into a wild beast and now and then we come upon some touch of a curious psychology so that we might almost seem to be read a modern poet as if euripide have be aware of a not unknown symptom of incipient madness in which the patient lose the sense of resistance while lift small object imagine himself to be raise enormous weight pentheus as he lift the thyrsus fancy he could lift cithaeron with all the bacchanal upon it at all this the laughter of course will pass round the theatre while those who really pierce into the purpose of the poet shudder as they see the victim thus grotesquely clothe go to his doom already foresee in the ominous chant of the chorusand as it be his graveclothe in the dress which make he ridiculous presently a messenger arrive to announce that pentheus be dead and then another curious narrative set forth the manner of his death full of wild coarse revolt detail of course not without pathetic touch and with the loveliness of the serve maenad and of their mountain solitudestheir tree and waternever quite forget it describe how venture as a spy too near the sacred circle pentheus be fall upon like a wild beast by the mystic huntress and tear to piece his mother be the first to begin and at last agave herself come upon the stage hold aloft the head of her son fix upon the sharp end of the thyrsus call upon the woman of the chorus to welcome the revel of the evian god who accordingly admit she into the company profess themselves her fellowreveller the bacchanal be thus absorb into the chorus for the rest of the play for indeed all through it the true though partly suppress relation of the chorus to the bacchanal be this that the woman of the chorus staid and temperate for the moment follow dionysus in his alternation be but the paler sister of his more wild and gloomy votariesthe true follower of the mystical dionysusthe real chorus of zagreus the idea that their violent proceeding be the result of madness only send on they as a punishment for their original rejection of the god be as i say when see from the deep motive of the myth only a of euripidesa piece of rationalism of which he avail himself for the purpose of soften down the tradition of which he have undertake to be the poet agave come on the stage then bloodstaine exulting in she still quite visibly mad indeed and with the outward sign of madness and as her mind wander muse still on the fancy that the dead head in her hand be that of a lion she have slay among the mountainsa young lion she aver as she notice the down on the young man chin and his abundant haira fancy in which the chorus humour her willing to deal gently with the poor distraught creature support by they she rejoice declare herself in such goodly spoil pride herself that the victim have be slay not with iron weapon but with her own white finger she summon all thebe to come and behold she call for her aged father to draw near and see and for pentheus himself at last that he may mount and rivet her trophy appropriately decorative there between the triglyph of the cornice below the roof visible to all and now from this point onwards dionysus himself become more and more clearly discernible as the hunter a wily hunter and man the prey he hunt for cry the chorus as they unite in agave triumph and give their sanction to her deed and as the bacchanal supplement the chorus and must be add to it to make the conception of it complete so in the conception of dionysus also a certain transference or substitution must be make much of the horror and sorrow of agave of pentheus of the whole tragic situation must be transfer to he if we wish to realise in the old profounder and more complete sense of his nature that mystical being of greek tradition to whom all these experienceshis madness the chase his imprisonment and death his peace again really belong and to discern which through euripide peculiar treatment of his subject be part of the curious interest of this play through the sophism of euripide for that again be the really descriptive word with which euripide a lover of sophism as aristophane know himself supply we wellthis soften version of the bacchic madness be a sophism of euripide and dionysus omophagusthe eater of raw flesh must be add to the golden image of dionysus meilichiusthe honeysweet if the old tradition in its completeness be to be in spite of that sophism our closing impression if we be to catch in its fulness that deep undercurrent of horror which run below all through this masque of spring and realise the spectacle of that wild chase in which dionysus be ultimately both the hunter and the spoil but meantime another person appear on the stage cadmus enter follow by attendant bear on a bi the tear limb of pentheus which lie wildly scatter through the tangled wood have be with difficulty collect and now decently put together and cover over in the little that still remain before the end of the play destiny now hurry thing rapidly forward and strong emotion hope and foreboding be now closely pack euripide have before he an artistic problem of enormous difficulty perhaps this very haste and closepacking of the matter which keep the mind from dwell overmuch on detail relieve its real extravagance and those who read it carefully will think that the pathos of euripide have be equal to the occasion in a few profoundly design touch he depict the perplexity of cadmus in whose house a god have become an inmate only to destroy itthe regret of the old man for the one male child to whom that house have look up as the pillar whereby aged people might feel secure the piteous craziness of agave the unconscious irony with which she caress the florid youthful head of her son the delicate breaking of the thing to her revive intelligence as cadmus though he can but wish that she might live on for ever in her visionary enjoyment prepare the way by play on that other horrible legend of the theban house the tearing of actaeon to deathhe too destroy by a god he give we the sense of agave gradual return to reason through many glimmer doubt till she wake up at last to find the real face turn up towards the mother and murderess the quite naturally spontaneous sorrow of the mother end with her confession down to her last sigh and the final breaking up of the house of cadmus with a result so genuine heartfelt and dignified withal in its expression of a strange ineffable woe that a fragment

curious than the myth of demeter and kore or persephone alien in some respect from the genuine tradition of greek mythology a relic of the early inhabitant of greece and have but a subordinate place in the religion of homer it yet assert its interest little by little and take a complex hold on the mind of the greek become finally the central and most popular subject of their national worship follow its change we come across various phase of greek culture which be not without their likeness in the modern mind we trace it in the dim first period of instinctive popular conception we see it connect itself with many impressive element of art and poetry and religious custom with the picturesque superstition of the many and with the fine intuition of the few and besides this it be in itself full of interest and suggestion to all for whom the idea of the greek religion have any real meaning in the modern world and the fortune of the myth have not desert it in later time in the year the longlost text of the homeric hymn to demeter be discover among the manuscript of the imperial library at moscow and in our own generation the tact of an eminent student of greek art sir charles newton have restore to the world the bury treasure of the little temple and precinct of demeter at cnidus which have many claim to rank in the central order of greek sculpture the present essay be an attempt to select and weave together for those who be now approach the deep study of greek think whatever detail in the development of this myth arrange with a view rather to a total impression than to the debate of particular point may seem likely to increase their stock of poetical impression and to add to this some criticism on the expression which it have leave of itself in extant art and poetry the central expression then of the story of demeter and persephone be the homeric hymn to which grote have assign a date at least as early as six hundred year before christ the one survivor of a whole family of hymn on this subject it be write perhaps for one of those contest which take place on the seventh day of the eleusinian festival and in which a bunch of ear of corn be the prize perhaps for actual use in the mystery themselves by the hierophante or interpreter who show to the worshipper at eleusis those sacred place to which the poem contain so many reference about the composition itself there be many difficult question with various surmise as to why it have remain only in this unique manuscript of the end of the fourteenth century portion of the text be miss and there be probably some addition by later hand yet most scholar have admit that it possess some of the true characteristic of the homeric style some genuine echo of the age immediately succeed that which produce the iliad and the odyssey listen now to a somewhat abbreviate version of it say the prizepoet or the interpreter the sacristan of the holy placesso long as she could still see the earth and the sky and the sea with the great wave move and the beam of the sun and still think to see again her mother and the race of the everliving god so long hope soothe she in the midst of her grief the peak of the hill and the depth of the sea echo her cry and the mother hear it a sharp pain seize she at the heart she pluck the veil from her hair and cast down the blue hood from her shoulder and flee forth like a bird seek persephone over dry land and sea but neither man nor god would tell she the truth nor do any bird come to she as a sure messenger then a more terrible grief take possession of demeter and in her anger against zeus she forsook the assembly of the god and abode among man for a long time veil her beauty under a worn countenance so that none who look upon she know she until she come to the house of celeus who be then king of eleusis in her sorrow she sit down at the wayside by the virgin well where the people of eleusis come to draw water under the shadow of an olive tree she seem as an aged woman whose time of childbearing be go by and from whom the gift of aphrodite have be withdraw like one of the hire servant who nurse the child or keep house in king palace and the daughter of celeus four of they like goddess possess the flower of their youth callidice cleisidice demo and callithoe the eld of they come to draw water that they might bear it in their brazen pitcher to their father house see demeter and know she not the god be hard for man to recognise demeter bow her head in assent and they having fill their shine vessel with water bear they away rejoice in their beauty they come quickly to their father house and tell their mother what they have see and hear their mother bade they return and hire the woman for a great price and they like the hind or young heifer leap in the field in spring fulfil with the pasture hold up the fold of their raiment speed along the hollow roadway their hair in colour like the crocus float about their shoulder as they go they find the glorious goddess still sit by the wayside unmove then they lead she to their father house and she veil from head to foot in her deep grief follow they on the way and her blue robe gather itself as she walk in many fold about her foot they come to the house and pass through the sunny porch where their mother metaneira be sit against one of the pillar of the roof have a young child in her bosom they run up to she but demeter cross the threshold and as she pass through her head rise and touch the roof and her presence fill the doorway with a divine brightness but the foolishness of his mother prevent it for a suspicion grow up within she she await her time and one night peep in upon they and thereupon cry out in terror at what she see and the goddess hear she and a sudden anger seize she she pluck the child from the fire and cast it on the groundthe child she would fain have make immortal but who must now share the common destiny of all man though some inscrutable grace should still be his because he have lain for awhile on the knee and in the bosom of the goddess so all night tremble with fear they seek to propitiate the glorious goddess and in the morning they tell all to their father celeus and he accord to the command of the goddess build a fair temple and all the people assist and when it be finish every man depart to his own home then demeter return and sit down within the templewall and remain still apart from the company of the god alone in she waste regret for her daughter persephone so they spend all that day together in intimate communion have many thing to hear and tell then zeus send to they rhea his venerable mother the old of divine person to bring they back reconcile to the company of the god and he ordain that persephone should remain two part of the year with her mother and one third part only with her husband in the kingdom of the dead so demeter suffer the earth to yield its fruit once more and the land be suddenly laden with leave and flower and wave corn also she visit triptolemus and the other prince of eleusis and instruct they in the performance of her sacred ritesthose mystery of which no tongue may speak only bless be he

moonlight place have their fortune and what be now the illustrious town of eleusis be then the field of an old man name celeus he be carry home a load of acorn and wild berry shake down from the bramble and dry wood for burn on the hearth his little daughter be lead two goat home from the hill and at home there be a little boy lie sick in his cradle mother say the little girland the goddess be move at the name of motherwhat do you all alone in this solitary place the old man stop too in spite of his heavy burden and bade her take shelter in his cottage though it be but a little one but at first she refuse to come she look like an old woman and an old woman coif confine her hair and as the man still urge she she say to he heaven bless you and may child always be yours my daughter

through the door she see the house full of trouble for now there be no more hope of life for the sick boy she salute the mother whose name be metaneira and humbly kiss the lip of the child with her own lip then the paleness leave its face and suddenly the parent see the strength return to its body so great be the force that come from the divine mouth and the whole family be full of joythe mother and the father and the little girl they be the whole household three profound ethical conception three impressive sacred figure have now define themselves for the greek imagination condense from all the tradition which have now be trace from the hymn of the poet from the instinctive and unformulated mysticism of primitive mind demeter be become the divine sorrow mother kore the goddess of summer be become persephone the goddess of death still associate with the form and odour of flower and fruit yet as one rise from the dead also present one side of her ambiguous nature to men gloomy fancy thirdly there be the image of demeter enthrone chastened by sorrow and somewhat advanced in age blessing the earth in her joy at the return of kore the myth have now enter on the third phase of its life in which it become the property of those more elevated spirit who in the decline of the greek religion pick and choose and modify with perfect freedom of mind whatever in it may seem adapt to minister to their culture in this way the myth of the greek religion become part of an ideal visible embodiment of the susceptibility and intuition of the nobler kind of soul and it be to this late phase of mythological development that the high greek sculpture ally itself its function be to give visible aesthetic expression to the constituent part of that ideal as poetry deal chiefly with the incident of the story so it be with the personage of the storywith demeter and kore themselvesthat sculpture have to do for the myth of demeter like the greek religion in general have its unloveli side grotesque unhellenic unglorifie by art illustrate well enough by the description pausanias give we of his visit to the cave of the black demeter at phigalia in his time the image itself have vanish but he tell we enough about it to enable we to realise its general characteristic monstrous as the special legend with which it be connect the black drapery the horse head unite to the womans body with the carve reptile creep about it if with the thought of this gloomy image of our mother the earth in our mind we take up one of those coin which bear the image of kore or demeter we shall well understand what the function of sculpture really be in elevate and refine the religious conception of the greek look on the profile for instance on one of those coin of messene which almost certainly represent demeter and note the crisp chaste opening of the lip the minutely wrought earring and the delicately touch ear of cornthis trifling object be justly regard as in its aesthetic quality an epitome of art on a large scalewe shall see how far the imagination of the greek have travel from what their black demeter show we have once be possible for they and in make the god of their worship the object of a worthy companionship in their thought certainly the mind of the old workman who strike that coin be if we may trust the testimony of his work unclouded by impure or gloomy shadow the thought of demeter be impressed here with all the purity and proportion the purge and dainty intelligence of the human countenance the mystery of it be indeed absent perhaps could hardly have be look for in so slight a thing intend for no sacred purpose and toss lightly from hand to hand but in his firm hold on the harmony of the human face the designer of this tranquil head of demeter be on the one road to a command over the secret of all imaginative pathos and mystery though in the perfect fairness and blitheness of his work he might seem almost not to have know the incident of her terrible story it be probable that at a later period than in other equally important temple of greece the early archaic representation of demeter in the sanctuary of eleusis be replace by a more beautiful image in the new style with face and hand of ivory have therefore in tone and texture some subtler likeness to women flesh and the closely enveloping drapery be construct in daintily beat plate of gold praxitele seem to have be the first to bring into the region of a free artistic handle these shy deity of the earth shrink still within the narrow restraint of a hieratic conventional treatment long after the more genuine olympian have break out of they the school of praxitele as distinguish from that of pheidia be especially the school of grace relax a little the severe ethical tension of the latter in favour of a slightly asiatic sinuosity and tenderness pausania tell we that he carve the two goddess for the temple of demeter at athens and pliny speak of two group of his in brass the one represent the stealing of persephone the other her later annual descent into hade conduct thither by the now pacified mother all alike have perish though perhaps some more or less faint reflexion of the most important of these design may still be trace on many paint vase which depict the stealing of persephonea helpless pluck flower in the arm of aidoneus and in this almost traditional form the subject be often represent in low relief on tomb some of which still remain in one or two instance build up oddly enough in the wall of christian church on the tomb of woman who have die in early life this be a favourite subject some likeness of the actual lineament of the deceased being sometimes transfer to the feature of persephone yet so far it might seem when we consider the interest of this story in itself and its importance in the greek religion that no adequate expression of it have remain to we in work of art but in the year the discovery of the marble in the sacred precinct of demeter at cnidus restore to we an illustration of the myth in its artistic phase hardly less central than the homeric hymn in its poetical phase with the help of the description and plan of mr newton book we can form as one always wish to do in such case a clear idea of the place where these marblesthree statue of the good style of greek sculpture now in the british museumwere find occupy a ledge of rock look towards the sea at the base of a cliff of upheaved limestone of singular steepness and regularity of surface the spot present indication of volcanic disturbance as if a chasm in the earth have open here it be this character suggest the belief in an actual connexion with the interior of the earth which probably give rise as in other case where the landscape present some peculiar feature in harmony with the story to the dedication upon it of a house and an image of demeter with whom be associate kore and hoi theoi para damatriaidoneus and the mystical or chthonian dionysus the house seem to have be a small chapel only of simple construction and design for private use the site itself having be private property consecrate by a particular family for their own religious use although other person servant or dependent of the founder may also have frequent it the architecture seem to have be insignificant but the sculpture costly and exquisite belong if contemporary with the erection of the building to a great period of greek art of which also it be judge to possess intrinsic marksabout the year before christ the probable date of the dedication of the little temple the artist by whom these work be produce be therefore either the contemporary of praxitele whose venus be for many century the glory of cnidus or belong to the generation immediately succeed he the temple itself be probably throw down by a renewal of the volcanic disturbance the statue however remain and the minister and worshipper still continue to make shift for their sacred business in the place now doubly venerable but with its temple unrestored down to the second or third century of the christian era its frequenter be now perhaps mere chance comer the family of the original donor having become extinct or having desert it into this later arrangement clearly divine by mr newton through those faint indication which mean much for true expert the extant remain as they be find upon the spot permit we to enter it be one of the grave of that old religion but with much still fresh in it we see it with its provincial superstition and its curious magic rite but also with its mean of really solemn impression in the culminate form of greek art the two face of the greek religion confront each other here and the whole have that rare peculiarity of a kind of personal stamp upon it the place having be design to meet the fancy of one particular soul or at least of one family it be always difficult to bring the every day aspect of greek religion home to we but even the slighter detail of this little sanctuary help we to do this and know so little as we do of the great mystery of demeter this glance into an actual religious place dedicate to she and with the air of her worship still about it be doubly interesting the little votive figure of the goddess in baked earth be still lie store in the small treasury intend for such object or scatter about the foot of the image together with lamp in great number a light lamp be a favourite offering in memory of the torch with which demeter seek persephone or from some sense of inherent darkness in these god of the earth those torch in the hand of demeter be indeed originally the artificial warmth and brightness of lamp and fire on winter night the dirae or spellskatadesmoi bind or devote certain person to the infernal god inscribe on thin roll of lead with hole sometimes for hang they up about those quiet statue still lay just as they be leave anywhere within the sacred precinct illustrating at once the gloomy side of the greek religion in general and of demeter and persephone especially in their character of avenge deity and as relic of ancient magic reproduce so strangely at other time and place remind we of the permanence of certain odd way of human think a woman bind with her spell the person who seduce her husband away from she and her child another the person who have accuse she of prepare poison for her husband another devote one who have not restore a borrow garment or have steal a bracelet or certain drinkinghorn and from some instance we might infer that this be a favourite place of worship for the poor and ignorant in this live picture we find still linger on at the foot of the beautiful greek marble that phase of religious temper which a cynical mind might think a truer link of its unity and permanence than any high aesthetic instinctsa phase of it which the art of sculpture humanising and refining man conception of the unseen tend constantly to do away for the high side of the greek religion thus humanise and refine by art and elevate by it to the sense of beauty be here also there be three ideal form as we saw gradually shape themselves in the development of the story of demeter wait only for complete realisation at the hand of the sculptor and now with these form in our mind let we place ourselves in thought before the three image which once probably occupy the three niche or ambrie in the face of that singular cliff at cnidus one of they be then work on a large scale of the three figure one probably represent persephone as the goddess of the dead the second demeter enthrone the third be probably a portraitstatue of a priestess of demeter but may perhaps even so represent demeter herself demeter achaea ceres deserta the mater dolorosa of the greek a type not as yet recognise in any other work of ancient art certainly it seem hard not to believe that this work be in some way connect with the legend of the place to which it belong and the main subject of which it realise so completely and at least it show how the high greek sculpture would have work out this motive if demeter at all it be demeter the seekerdêôas she be call in the mystery in some pause of her restless wandering over the world in search of the lose child and become at last an abstract type of the wanderer the homeric hymn as we saw have its sculptural motive the great gesture of demeter who be ever the stately goddess as she follow the daughter of celeus or sit by the wellside or go out and in through the hall of the palace express in monumental word with the sentiment of that monumental homeric presence this statue be penetrate unite a certain solemnity of attitude and bear to a profound piteousness an unrivalled pathos of expression there be something of the pity of michelangelos mater dolorosa in the waste form and marred countenance yet with the light break faintly over it from the eye which contrary to the usual practice in ancient sculpture be represent as look upwards it be the aged woman who have escape from pirate who have but just escape be sell as a slave call on the young for pity the sorrow of her long wandering seem to have pass into the marble and in this too it meet the demand which the reader of the homeric hymn with its command over the resource of human pathos make upon the sculptor the tall figure in proportion above the ordinary height be veil and clothe to the foot in the long tunic its numerous fold hang in heavy parallel line oppose the line of the peplus or cloak which cross it diagonally over the breast enwrap the upper portion of the body somewhat closely it be the very type of the wander woman go grandly indeed as homer describe she yet so human in her anguish that we seem to recognise some far descended shadow of she in the homely figure of the roughly clothe french peasant woman who in one of corot picture be haste along under a sad light as the day go out behind the little hill we have watch the growth of the merely personal sentiment in the story and we may notice that if this figure be indeed demet then the conception of she have become wholly humanise no trace of the primitive cosmical import of the myth no colour or scent of the mystical earth remain about it the seat figure much mutilate and wear by long exposure yet possess accord to the good critic mark of the school of praxitele be almost undoubtedly the image of demeter enthrone three time in the homeric hymn she be represent as sit once by the fountain at the wayside again in the house of celeus and again in the newly finish temple of eleusis but always in sorrow seat on the petra agelasto which as ovid tell we the people of attica still call the stone of sorrow here she be represent in her later state of reconciliation enthrone as the glorify mother of all thing the delicate plaiting of the tunic about the throat the formal curling of the hair and a certain weight of overthoughtfulness in the brow recall the manner of leonardo da vinci a master one of whose characteristics be a very sensitive expression of the sentiment of maternity it remind one especially of a work by one of his scholar the virgin of the balance in the louvre a picture which have be think to represent under a veil the blessing of universal nature and in which the sleepylooke head with a peculiar grace and refinement of somewhat advanced life in they have just this halfweary posture we see here then the here of the world below the stygian juno the chief of those elysian matron who come crowd in the poem of claudian to the marriage toilet of proserpine the goddess of the fertility of the earth and of all creature but still of fertility as arise out of death and therefore she be not without a certain pensiveness having see the seed fall into the ground and die many time persephone be return to she and the hair spread like a rich harvest over her shoulder but she be still veil and know that the seed must fall into the ground again and persephone descend again from she the statue of the suppose priestess and of the enthroned demeter be of more than the size of life the figure of persephone be but seventeen inch high a daintily handle toy of parian marble the miniature copy perhaps of a much large work which might well be reproduce on a magnify scale the conception of demeter be throughout chiefly human and even domestic though never without a hieratic interest because she be not a goddess only but also a priestess in contrast persephone be wholly unearthly the close companion and even the confuse double of hecate the goddess of midnight terrorsdespoenathe final mistress of all that live and as sorrow be the characteristic sentiment of demeter so awe of persephone she be compact of sleep and death and flower but of narcotic flower especiallya revenant who in the garden of aidoneus have eat of the pomegranate and bear always the secret of decay in she of return to the grave in the mystery of those swallow seed sometimes in later work hold in her hand the key of the great prisonhouse but which unlock all secret also sometimes like demeter the poppy emblem of sleep and death by its narcotic juice of life and resurrection by its innumerable seed of the dream therefore that may intervene between fall asleep and wake treat as it be in the homeric hymn and still more in this statue the image of persephone may be regard as the result of many effort to lift the old chthonian gloom still linger on in heavy soul concern the grave to connect it with impression of dignity and beauty and a certain sweetness even it be mean to make man in love or at least at peace with death the persephone of praxitele school then be aphroditepersephone venuslibitina her shadowy eye have gaze upon the fainter colour of the under world and the tranquillity bear of it have for the greek hade be after all but a quiet twilight place not very different from that house of fame where dante place the great soul of the classical world aidoneus himself be conceive in the high greek sculpture as but a gentler zeus the great innkeeper so that when a certain greek sculptor have fail in his portraiture of zeus because it have too little hilarity too little in the eye and brow of the open and cheerful sky he only change its title and the thing pass excellently with its heavy lock and shadowy eyebrow for the god of the dead the image of persephone then as it be here compose with the tall towerlike headdress from which the veil dependsthe cornbasket originally carry thus by the greek woman balance on the headgiving the figure unusual length have the air of a body bind about with grave clothe while the archaic hand and foot and a certain stiffness in the fold of the drapery give it something of a hieratic character and to the modern observer may suggest a sort of kinship with the more chastened kind of gothic work but quite of the school of praxitele be the general character of the composition the graceful waving of the hair the fine shadow of the little face of the eye and lip especially like the shadow of a flowera flower rise noiselessly from its dwelling in the dustthough still with that fulness or heaviness in the brow as of sleepy people which in the delicate gradation of greek sculpture distinguish the infernal deity from their olympian kindre the object place in the hand may be perhaps a stiff archaic flower but be probably the partly consume pomegranateone morsel go the most usual emblem of persephone be this mystical fruit which because of the multitude of its seed be to the roman a symbol of fecundity and be sell at the door of the temple of cere that the woman might offer it there and bear numerous child and so to the middle age become a symbol of the fruitful earth itself and then of that other seed sow in the dark underworld and at last of that whole hidden region so thickly sow which dante visit michelino paint he in the duomo of florence with this fruit in his hand and botticelli put it into the childish hand of he who if man there be an attractiveness in these goddess of the earth akin to the influence of cool place quiet house subdue light tranquillising voice what be there in this phase of ancient religion for we at the present day the myth of demeter and persephone then illustrate the power of the greek religion as a religion of pure ideasof conception which have no link on historical fact yet because they arise naturally out of the spirit of man and embody in adequate symbol his deep thought concern the condition of his physical and spiritual life maintain their hold through many change and be still not without a solemnise power even for the modern mind

in the haunted grove of aricia far from his old attic home in a land which have never see he as he be the beginning of greek sculpture i the heroic age of greek art the extant remain of greek sculpture though but a fragment of what the greek sculptor produce be both in number and in excellence in their fitness therefore to represent the whole of which they be a part quite out of proportion to what have come down to we of greek painting and all those minor craft which in the greek workshop as at all period when the art have be really vigorous be closely connect with the high imaginative work greek painting be represent to we only by its distant reflexion on the wall of the bury house of pompeii and the design of subordinate though exquisite craftsman on the vase of wrought metal partly through the inherent usefulness of its material tempt ignorant person into whose hand it may fall to refashion it we have comparatively little while in consequence of the perishableness of their material nothing remain of the curious woodwork the carve ivory the embroidery and coloured stuff on which the greek set much storeof that whole system of refined artisanship diffuse like a general atmosphere of beauty and richness around the more exalted creation of greek sculpture what we possess then of that high greek sculpture be present to we in a sort of threefold isolation isolation first of all from the concomitant artsthe frieze of the parthenon without the metal bridle on the horse for which the hole in the marble remain isolation secondly from the architectural group of which with most careful estimate of distance and point of observation that frieze for instance be design to be a part isolation thirdly from the clear greek sky the poetical greek life in our modern gallery and if one here or there in look at these thing bethink himself of the require substitution if he endeavour mentally to throw they back into that proper atmosphere through which alone they can exercise over we all the magic by which they charm their original spectator the effort be not always a successful one within the grey wall of the louvre or the british museum and the circumstance that greek sculpture be present to we in such falsify isolation from the work of the weaver the carpenter and the goldsmith have encourage a manner of regard it too little sensuous approach it with full information concern what may be call the inner life of the greek their mode of thought and sentiment amply record in the writing of the greek poet and philosopher but with no lively impression of that mere craftsman world of which so little have remain student of antiquity have for the most part interpret the creation of greek sculpture rather as element in a sequence of abstract idea as embodiment in a sort of petrified language of pure thought and as interesting mainly in connexion with the development of greek intellect than as element of a sequence in the material order as result of a design and skilful dealing of accomplished finger with precious form of matter for the delight of the eye greek sculpture have come to be regard as the product of a peculiarly limit art deal with a specially abstract range of subject and the greek sculptor as a workman almost exclusively intellectual have only a sort of accidental connexion with the material in which his thought be express he be fancy to have be disdainful of such matter as the mere tone the fibre or texture of his marble or cedarwood of that just perceptible yellowness for instance in the ivorylike surface of the venus of melos as be occupy only with form as abstract almost as the conception of philosophy and translateable it might be suppose into any materiala habit of regard he still far encourage by the modern sculptor usage of employ merely mechanical labour in the actual working of the stone the work of the high greek sculpture be indeed intellectualise if we may say so to the utmost degree the human figure which they present to we seem actually to conceive thought in they that profoundly reasonable spirit of design which be traceable in greek art continuously and increasingly upwards from its simple product the oilvessel or the urn reach its perfection yet though the most abstract and intellectualise of sensuous object they be still sensuous and material address themselves in the first instance not to the purely reflective faculty but to the eye and a complete criticism must have approach they from both side from the side of the intelligence indeed towards which they rank as great thought come down into the stone but from the sensuous side also towards which they rank as the most perfect result of that pure skill of hand of which the venus of melos we may say be the high example and the little polished pitcher or lamp also perfect in its way perhaps the low to pass by the purely visible side of these thing then be not only to miss a refining pleasure but to mistake altogether the medium in which the most intellectual of the creation of greek art the aeginetan or the elgin marble for instance be actually produce even these have in their origin depend for much of their charm on the mere material in which they be execute and the whole black and grey world of extant antique sculpture need to be translate back into ivory and gold if we would feel the excitement which the greek seem to have feel in the presence of these object to have this really greek sense of greek sculpture it be necessary to connect it indeed with the inner life of the greek world its thought and sentiment on the one hand but on the other hand to connect it also with the minor work of price intaglio coin vase with that whole system of material refinement and beauty in the outer greek life which these minor work represent to we and it be with these as far as possible that we must seek to relieve the air of our gallery and museum of their too intellectual greyness greek sculpture could not have be precisely a cold thing and whatever a colourblind school may say pure thought have their coldness a coldness which have sometimes repel from greek sculpture with its unsuspected fund of passion and energy in material form those who care much and with much insight for a similar passion and energy in the coloured world of italian painting theoretically then we need that world of the minor art as a complementary background for the high and more austere greek sculpture and as matter of fact it be just with such a worldwith a period of refined and exquisite tectonic that greek art actually begin in what be call the heroic age that early undefined period of greek civilisation the beginning of which can not be date and which reach down to the first olympiad about the year bc of this period we possess indeed no direct history and but few actual monument great or small but as to its whole character and outward local colouring for its art as for its politic and religion homer may be regard as an authority the iliad and the odyssey the early picture of that heroic life represent it as already delight itself in the application of precious material and skilful handiwork to personal and domestic adornment to the refining and beautifying of the entire outward aspect of life above all in the lavish application of very graceful metalwork to such purpose and this representation be bear out by what little we possess of its actual remain and by all we can infer mixed of course with mere fable as a description of the heroic age the picture which homer present to we deprive of its supernatural adjunct become continuously more and more realisable as the actual condition of early art when we emerge gradually into historical time and find ourselves at last among dateable work and real school or master the history of greek art then begin as some have fancy general history to begin in a golden age but in an age so to speak of real gold the period of those first twister and hammerer of the precious metalsman who have already discover the flexibility of silver and the ductility of gold the capacity of both for infinite delicacy of handling and who enjoy with complete freshness a sense of beauty and fitness in their worka period of which that flower of gold on a silver stalk pick up lately in one of the grave at mycenae or the legendary golden honeycomb of daedalus might serve as the symbol the heroic age of greek art be the age of the hero as smith there be in homer two famous descriptive passage in which this delight in curious metalwork be very prominent the description in the iliad of the shield of achille and the description of the house of alcinous in the odyssey the shield of achille be part of the suit of armour which hephaestus make for he at the request of thetis and it be work of variously colour metal weave into a great circular composition in relief represent the world and the life in it the various activity of man be record in this description in a series of idyllic incident with such complete freshness liveliness and variety that the reader from time to time may well forget himself and fancy he be read a mere description of the incident of actual life we peep into a little greek town and see in dainty miniature the bride come from her chamber with torchbearer and dancer the people gaze from their door a quarrel between two person in the marketplace the assembly of the elder to decide upon it in another quartering be the spectacle of a city besiege the wall defend by the old man while the soldier have steal out and be lie in ambush there be a fight on the riverbank are and athene conspicuous in gold and mark as divine person by a scale large than that of their follower lead the host the strange mythical image of kêr eris and kudoimos mingle in the crowd a third space upon the shield depict the incident of peaceful labourthe ploughshare pass through the field of enameled black metal behind it and golden before the cup of mead hold out to the ploughman when he reach the end of the furrow the reaper with their sheaf the king stand in silent pleasure among they intent upon his staff there be the labourer in the vineyard in minute detail stake of silver on which the vine hang the dark trench about it and one pathway through the midst the whole complete and distinct in variously colour metal all thing and living creature be in their placesthe cattle come to water to the sound of the herdsman pipe various music the rush by the waterside a lionhunt with dog the pasture among the hill a dance the fair dress of the male and female dancer the former adorn with sword the latter with crown it be an image of ancient life its pleasure and business for the centre as in some quaint chart of the heavens be the earth and the sun the moon and constellation and to close in all right round like a frame to the picture the great river oceanus form the rim of the shield in some metal of dark blue still more fascinating perhaps because more completely realisable by the fancy as an actual thingrealisable as a delightful place to pass time ini the description of the palace of alcinous in the little island town of the phaeacian to which we be introduce in all the liveliness and sparkle of the morning as real as something see last summer on the seacoast although appropriately ulysse meet a goddess like a young girl carry a pitcher on his way up from the sea below the steep wall of the town two project jetty allow a narrow passage into a haven of stone for the ship into which the passerby may look down as they lie moor below the roadway in the midst be the king house all glitter again with curiously wrought metal its brightness be the heart of ulysse beat quickly when he see it stand amid plantation ingeniously water its floor and wall of brass throughout with continuous cornice of dark iron the door be of gold the doorpost and lintel of silver the handle again of gold the wall be massy brass the cornice high blue metal crown in colour of the sky rich plate of gold the foldingdoor incase the pillar silver on a brazen base

humanheade bull at the entrance of an assyrian palace within door the burn light at suppertime be support in the hand of golden image of boy while the guest recline on a couch run all along the wall cover with peculiarly sumptuous women work from these two glitter description manifestly something must be deduct we be in wonderland and among supernatural or magical condition but the forging of the shield and the wonderful house of alcinous be no merely incongruous episode in homer but the consummation of what be always characteristic of he a constant preoccupation namely with every form of lovely craftsmanship rest on all thing as he say like the shining of the sun we seem to pass in read he through the treasure of some royal collection in he the presentation of almost every aspect of life be beautify by the work of cunning hand the throne coffer couch of curious carpentry be stud with bossy ornament of precious metal effectively dispose or inlay with stain ivory or blue cyanus or amber or pale amberlike gold the surface of the stone conduit the seawall the public washingtrough the rampart on which the weary soldier rest themselves when return to troy be fair and smooth all the fine quality in colour and texture of woven stuff be carefully notedthe fineness closeness softness pliancy glos the whiteness or nectarlike tint in which the weaver delight to work to weave the seapurple thread be the appropriate function of queen and noble woman all the homeric shield be more or less ornamented with variously colour metal terrible sometimes like leonardo with some monster or grotesque the numerous sort of cup be boss with golden stud or have handle work with figure of dove for instance the great brazen cauldron bear an epithet which mean flowery the trapping of the horse the various part of the chariot be form of various metal the women ornament and the instrument of their toilet be describe porpas te gnamptas th helikas kalukas te kai hormous the golden vial for unguent use and beauty be still undivide all that men hand be set to make have still a fascination alike for workman and spectator for such dainty splendour troy indeed be especially conspicuous but then homer trojan be essentially greeksgreek of asia and troy though more advanced in all element of civilisation be no real contrast to the western shore of the aegean it be no barbaric world that we see but the sort of world we may think that would have charm also our comparatively jade sensibility with just that quaint simplicity which we too enjoy in its production above all in its wrought metal which lose perhaps more than any other sort of work by become mechanical the metalwork which homer describe in such variety be all hammerwork all the joining be effect by pin or rivet that be just the sort of metalwork which in a certain naïveté and vigour be still of all work the most expressive of actual contact with dexterous finger one seem to trace in it on every particle of the partially resist material the touch and play of the shaping instrument in highly train hand under the guidance of exquisitely discipline sensesthat cachet or seal of nearness to the workmans hand which be the special charm of all good metalwork of early metalwork in particular such description however it may be say be mere poetical ornament of no value in help we to define the character of an age but what be peculiar in these homeric description what distinguish they from other at first sight similar be a sort of internal evidence they present of a certain degree of reality sign in they of an imagination stir by surprise at the spectacle of real work of art such minute delight love description of detail of ornament such follow out of the way in which brass gold silver or paler gold go into the chariot and armour and women dress or cle to the wallsthe enthusiasm of the manner be the warrant of a certain amount of truth in all that the greek poet describe these thing with the same vividness and freshness the same kind of fondness with which other poet speak of flower speak of they poetically indeed but with that high sort of poetry which seem full of the lively impression of delightful thing recently see genuine poetry it be true be always naturally sympathetic with all beautiful sensible thing and quality but with how many poet would not this constant intrusion of material ornament have produce a tawdry effect the metal would all be tarnish and the edge blur and this be because it be not always that the product of even exquisite tectonic can excite or refine the aesthetic sense now it be probable that the object of oriental art the imitation of it at home in which for homer this actual world of art must have consist reach he in a quantity and with a novelty just sufficient to warm and stimulate without surfeit the imagination it be an exotic thing of which he see just enough and not too much the shield of achille the house of alcinous be like dream indeed but this sort of dream wind continuously through the entire iliad and odysseya child dream after a day of real fresh impression from thing themselves in which all those float impression reset themselves he be as pleased in touch and look at those object as his own hero their gleam aspect brighten all he say and have take hold one might think of his language his very vocabulary become chryselephantine homer artistic description though enlarge by fancy be not wholly imaginary and the extant remain of monument of the early historical age be like linger relic of that dream in a tame but real world the art of the heroic age then as represent in homer connect itself on the one side with those fabulous jewel so prominent in mythological story and entwine sometimes so oddly in its representation of human fortunesthe necklace of eriphyle the necklace of helen which menelaus it be said offer at delphi to athene pronoea on the eve of his expedition against troymythical object indeed but which yet bear witness even thus early to the aesthetic susceptibility of the greek temper but on the other hand the art of the heroic age connect itself also with the actual early beginning of artistic production there be touch of reality for instance in homer incidental notice of its instrument and process especially as regard the working of metal he go already to the potter wheel for familiar lifelike illustration in describe artistic woodwork he distinguish various stage of work we see clearly the instrument for turn and bore such as the oldfashioned drillborer whirl round with a string he mention the name of two artist the one of an actual workman the other of a craft turn into a proper namestray relic accidentally preserve of a world as we may believe of such wide and varied activity the forge of hephaestus be a true forge the magic tripod on which he be at work be really put together by conceivable process know in early time composition in relief similar to those which he describe be actually make out of thin metal plate cut into a convenient shape and then beat into the design form by the hammer over a wooden model these relief be then fasten to a differently colour metal background or base with nail or rivet for there be no soldering of metal as yet to this process the ancient give the name of empaestik such emboss be still in our own time a beautiful form of metalwork even in the marvellous shield there be other and indirect note of reality in speak of the shield of achille i depart intentionally from the order in which the subject of the relief be actually introduce in the iliad because just then i wish the reader to receive the full effect of the variety and elaborateness of the composition as a representation or picture of the whole of ancient life embrace within the circumference of a shield but in the order in which homer actually describe those episode he be follow the method of a very practicable form of composition and be throughout much close than we might at first sight suppose to the ancient armourer proceeding the shield be form of five superimpose plate of different metal each plate of small diameter than the one immediately below it their flat margin show thus as four concentric stripe or ring of metal around a sort of boss in the centre five metal thick and the outermost circle or ring be the thin to this arrangement the order of homer description correspond the earth and the heavenly body be upon this boss in the centre like a little distant heaven hang above the broad world and from this homer work out round and round to the river oceanus which form the border of the whole the subject answer to or support each other in a sort of heraldic orderthe city at peace set over against the city besiege spring summer and autumn balance each otherquite congruously with a certain heraldic turn common in contemporary assyrian art which delight in this sort of conventional spacing out of its various subject and especially with some extant metal charger of assyrian work which like some of the early greek vase with their paint plant and flower conventionally arrange illustrate in their humble measure such heraldic group the description of the shield of hercule attribute to hesiod be probably an imitation of homer and notwithstanding some fine mythological impersonation which it contain an imitation less admirable than the original of painting there be in homer no certain indication and it be consistent with the later date of the imitator that we may perhaps discern in his composition a sign that what he have actually see be a paint shield in the predominance in it as compare with the homeric description of effect of colour over effect of form homer delight in ingenious device for fasten the metal and the suppose hesiod rather in what seem like triumph of heraldic colouring though the latter also delight in effect of mingle metal of mingled gold and silver especially silver figure with dress of gold silver centaur with pinetree of gold for stave in their hand still like the shield of achille this too we must conceive as form of concentric plate of metal and here again that spacing be still more elaborately carry out narrow intermediate ring be apparently introduce between the broad one with figure in rapid horizontal unbroken motion carry the eye right round the shield in contrast with the repose of the downward or inward movement of the subject which divide the large space here too with certain analogy in the row of animal to the design on the early vase in hesiod then as in homer there be undesigned note of correspondence between the partly mythical ornament imaginatively enlarge of the heroic age and a world of actual handicraft in the shield of hercule another marvellous detail be add in the image of perseus very daintily describe as hover in some wonderful way as if really bear up by wing above the surface and that curious haunting sense of magic in art which come out over and over again in homerin the golden maid for instance who assist hephaestus in his work and similar detail which seem at first sight to destroy the credibility of the whole picture and make of it a mere wonderlandi itself also rightly understand a testimony to a real excellence in the art of homer time it be sometimes say that work of art hold to be miraculous be always of an inferior kind but at least it be not among those who think they inferior that the belief in their miraculous power begin if the golden image move like living creature and the armour of achille so wonderfully make lift he like wing this again be because the imagination of homer be really under the stimulus of delightful artistic object actually see only those to whom such artistic object manifest themselves through real and powerful impression of their wonderful quality can invest they with property magical or miraculous i say that the inherent usefulness of the material of metalwork make the destruction of its acquire form almost certain if it come into the possession of people either barbarous or careless of the work of a past time greek art be for we in all its stage a fragment only in each of they it be necessary in a somewhat visionary manner to fill up empty space and more or less make substitution and of the fine work of the heroic age thus dimly discern as an actual thing we have at least till recently almost nothing two plate of bronze a few rusty nail and certain row of hole in the inner surface of the wall of the of mycenae be the sole representative of that favourite device of primitive greek art the lining of stone wall with burnish metal of which the house of alcinous in the odyssey be the ideal picture and the temple of pallas of the brazen house at sparta adorn in the interior with a coating of relief in metal a later historical example of the heroic or socalled cyclopean architecture that a building so impose that pausania think it worthy to rank with the pyramid be a sufficient illustration treasury or tomb or both this domeshape building form of concentric ring of stone gradually diminish to a copingstone at the top may stand as the representative of some similar building in other part of greece and of many other in a similar kind of architecture elsewhere construct of large manysided block of stone fit carefully together without the aid of cement and remain in their place by reciprocal resistance characteristic of it be the general tendency to use vast block of stone for the jamb and lintel of door for instance and in the construction of gableshape passage two row of such stone be make to rest against each other at an acute angle within the thickness of the wall so vast and rude fret by the action of nearly three thousand year the fragment of this architecture may often seem at first sight like work of nature at argos tiryn mycenae the skeleton of the old architecture be more complete at mycenae the gateway of the acropolis be still stand with its two wellknown sculpture lionsimmemorial and almost unique monument of primitive greek sculpturesupporte heraldwise a symbolical pillar on the vast triangular pedimental stone above the head be go having be fashion possibly in metal by workman from the east on what may be call the façade remain be still discernible of inlaid work in coloured stone and within the gateway on the smooth slab of the pavement the wheelrut be still visible connect they with those metal warchariot in homer and you may see in fancy the whole grandiose character of the place as it may really have be shut within the narrow enclosure of these shadowy citadel be the palace of the king with all that intimacy which we may sometimes suppose to have be alien from the openair greek life admit doubtless below the cover of their rough wall many of those refinement of princely life which the middle age find possible in such place and of which the impression be so fascinating in homer description for instance of the house of ulysse or of menelaus at sparta rough and frown without these old châteaux of the argive king be delicate within with a decoration almost as dainty and fine as the network of weed and flower that now cover their ruin and of the delicacy of which as i say that golden flower on its silver stalk or the golden honeycomb of daedalus might be take as representative in these metallike structure of selfsupporte polygon lock so firmly and impenetrably together with the whole mystery of the reasonableness of the arch implicitly within they there be evidence of a complete artistic command over weight in stone and an understanding of the but over weight only the ornament still seem to be not strictly architectural but accord to the notice of homer tectonic borrow from the sister art above all from the art of the metalworker to whom those space of the building be leave which a later age fill with painting or relief in stone the skill of the asiatic come to adorn this rough native building and it be a late elaborate somewhat voluptuous skill we may understand illustrate by the luxury of that asiatic chamber of paris less like that of a warrior than of one go to the dance couple with the vastness of the architectural work which actually remain such description as that in homer of the chamber of paris and the house of alcinous furnish forth a picture of that early periodthe tyrant age the age of the acropoleis the period of great dynasty with claim to and in many instance at least with all the culture of their time the vast building make we sigh at the thought of waste human labour though there be a public usefulness too in some of these design such as the draining of the copaic lake to which the back of the people be bent whether they will or not for the prince there be much of that selfish personal luxury which be a constant trait of feudalism in all age for the people scatter over the country at their agricultural labour or gather in small hamlet there be some enjoyment perhaps of the aspect of that splendour of the bright warrior on the heightsa certain share of the nobler pride of the tyrant themselves in those tomb and dwelling some surmise also there seem to have be of the of gold with a dim lurking suspicion of curious facility for cruelty in the command over those skilful artificer in metal some ingenious rack or bull the tradition of which not unlike the modern jacque bonhomme shudder at the old ruin french donjon or bastille haunt generation afterwards the ruin of those of stone where the old tyrant have their pleasure for it be a mistake to suppose that that wistful sense of eeriness in ruin building to which most of we be susceptible be an exclusively modern feeling the name cyclopean attach to those desolate remain of building which be old than greek history itself attest their romantic influence over the fancy of the people who thus attribute they to a superhuman strength and skill and the cyclops like all the early mythical name of artist have this note of reality that they be name not of individual but of class the guild or company of workman in which a certain craft be impart and transmit the dactyli the finger be the first worker in iron the savage chalybe in scythia the first smelter actual name be give to the old fabled telchine chalkon argyron chrysonworker in brass silver and gold respectively the tradition of their activity haunt the several region where those metal be find they make the trident of poseidon but then poseidon trident be a real fisherman instrument the tunnyfork they be credit notwithstanding with an evil sorcery unfriendly to man as poor humanity remember the maker of chain lock procrustean bed and as become this dark recondite mine and metal work the tradition about they be gloomy and grotesque confusing mortal workman with demon guild to this view of the heroic age of greek art as be so to speak an age of real gold an age delight itself in precious material and exquisite handiwork in all tectonic craft the recent extraordinary discovery at troy and mycenae be on any plausible theory of their date and origin a witness the aesthetic critic need always to be on his guard against the confusion of mere curiosity or antiquity with beauty in art among the object discover at troymere curiosity some of they however interesting and instructivethe socalled royal cup of priam in solid gold twohandle and double lipped have in the very simplicity of its design the grace of the economy with which it exactly fulfil its purpose a positive beauty an absolute value for the aesthetic sense while strange and new enough if it really settle at last a muchdebate expression of homer while the with its twisted chain and flower of pale gold show that those profuse golden fringe wave so comely as he move which hephaestus work for the helmet of achille be really within the compass of early greek art and the story of the excavation at mycenae read more like some welldevised chapter of fiction than a record of sober fact here those sanguine halfchildish dream of bury treasure discover in dead men grave which seem to have a charm for every one be more than fulfil in the spectacle of those antique king lie in the splendour of their crown and breastplate of embossed plate of gold their sword stud with golden imagery at their side as in some feudal monument their very face cover up most strangely in golden mask the very floor of one tomb we read be thick with gold dustthe heavy gilding fall from some perish kingly vestment in another be a downfall of golden leave and flower and amid this profusion of thin fine fragment be ring bracelet small crown as if for child dainty butterfly for ornament of dress and that golden flower on a silver stalkall of pure soft gold unhardene by alloy the delicate film of which one must touch but lightly yet twist and beat by hand and hammer into wavy spiral relief the cuttlefish with its long undulating arm appear frequently it be the very image of the old luxurious life of the prince of the heroic age as homer describe it with the art in service to its kingly pride among the other costly object be one represent the head of a cow grandly design in gold with horn of silver like the horn of the moon suppose to be symbolical of here the great object of worship at argo one of the interest of the study of mythology be that it reflect the way of life and thought of the people who conceive it and this religion of here the special religion of argo be congruous with what have be here say as to the place of art in the civilisation of the argive it be a reflexion of that splendid and wanton old feudal life for here be in her original essence and mean equivalent to demeterthe one live spirit of the earth divine behind the veil of all its manifold visible energy but in the development of a common mythological motive the various people be subject to the general limitation of their life and think they can but work outward what be within they and the religious conception and usage ultimately derivable from one and the same rudimentary instinct be sometimes most diverse out of the visible physical energy of the earth and its system of annual change the old pelasgian mind develop the person of demeter mystical and profoundly aweful yet profoundly pathetic also in her appeal to human sympathy out of the same original element the civilisation of argo on the other hand develop the religion of queen here a mere demeter at good of gaudy flowerbed whose toilet homer describe with all its delicate finery though characteristically he may still allow we to detect perhaps some trace of the mystical person of the earth in the allpervading scent of the ambrosial unguent with which she anoint herself in the abundant tress of her hair and in the curious variegation of her ornament she have become though with some reminiscence of the mystical earth a very limited human person wicke angry jealousthe lady of zeus in her castlesanctuary at mycenae in wanton dalliance with the king coax he for cruel purpose in sweet sleep add artificial charm to her beauty such be some of the characteristic with which greek art be discernible in that early age of themselves they almost answer the question which next ariseswhence do art come to greece or be it a thing of absolutely native growth there so some have decidedly maintain other who live in an age possess little or no knowledge of greek monument anterior to the full development of art under pheidia and who in regard to the greek sculpture of the age of pheidia be like people criticise michelangelo without knowledge of the early tuscan schoolof the work of donatello and mino da fiesoleeasily satisfy themselves with theory of its importation readymade from other country critic in the last century especially notice some characteristic which early greek work have in common indeed with egyptian art but which be common also to all such early work everywhere suppose as a matter of course that it come as the greek religion also from egyptthat old immemorial halfknown birthplace of all wonderful thing there be it be true authority for this derivation among the greek themselves dazzle as they be by the marvel of the ancient civilisation of egypt a civilisation so different from their own on the first opening of egypt to greek visitor but in fact that opening do not take place till the reign of psammetichus about the middle of the seventh century bc a relatively late date psammetichus introduce and settle greek mercenary in egypt and for a time the greek come very close to egyptian life they can hardly fail to have be stimulate by that display of every kind of artistic workmanship gleam over the whole of life they may in turn have freshen it with new motive and we may remark that but for the peculiar usage of egypt concern the tomb of the dead but for their habit of invest the last abode of the dead with all the appurtenance of active life out of that whole world of art so various and elaborate nothing but the great monumental work in stone would have remain to ourselves we should have experience in regard to it what we actually experience too much in our knowledge of greek artthe lack of a fitting background in the small tectonic work for its great work in architecture and the bolder sort of sculpture but one by one at last as in the medieval parallel monument illustrative of the early growth of greek art before the time of pheidia have come to light and to a just appreciation they show that the development of greek art have already proceed some way before the opening of egypt to the greek and point if to a foreign source at all to oriental rather than egyptian influence and the theory which derive greek art with many other greek thing from egypt now hardly find supporter in greece all thing be at once old and new as in physical organism the actual particle of matter have exist long before in other combination and what be really new in a new organism be the new cohere forcethe mode of lifeso in the product of greek civilisation the actual element be traceable elsewhere by antiquarian who care to trace they the element for instance of its peculiar national architecture yet all be also emphatically autochthonous as the greek say newborn at home by right of a new informing combine spirit play over those mere element and touch they above all with a wonderful sense of the nature and destiny of manthe dignity of his soul and of his bodyso that in all thing the greek be as discoverer still the original and primary motive seem in matter of art to have come from without and the view to which actual discovery and all true analogy more and more point be that of a connexion of the origin of greek art ultimately with assyria proximately with phoenicia partly through asia minor and chiefly through cyprusan original connexion again and again reassert like a survive trick of inheritance as in later time it come in contact with the civilisation of caria and lycia old affinity be here link anew and with a certain asiatic tradition of which one representative be the ionic style of architecture traceable all through greek artan asiatic curiousness or poikilia strong in that heroic age of which i have be speak and distinguish some school and master in greece more than other and always in appreciable distinction from the more clearly define and selfasserte hellenic influence homer himself witness to the intercourse through early adventurous commerce as in the bright and animate picture with which the history of herodotus begin between the greek and eastern country we may perhaps forget sometimes think over the greatness of its place in the history of civilisation how small a country greece really be how short the distance upwards from island to island to the coast of asia so that we can hardly make a sharp separation between asia and greece nor deny besides great and palpable act of importation all sort of impalpable asiatic influence by way alike of attraction and repulsion upon greek manner and taste homer as we see be right in make troy essentially a greek city with inhabitant superior in all culture to their kinsman on the western shore and perhaps proportionally weak on the practical or moral side and with an element of languid ionian voluptuousness in they typify by the cedar and gold of the chamber of parisan element which the austere more strictly european influence of the dorian apollo will one day correct in all genuine greek the aegean with its island be then a bond of union not a barrier and we must think of greece as have be rightly say as its whole continuous shore the characteristic of greek art indeed in the heroic age so far as we can discern they be those also of phoenician art its delight in metal among the rest of metal especially as an element in architecture the covering of everything with plate of metal it be from phoenicia that the costly material in which early greek art delight actually cameivory amber much of the precious metal these the adventurous phoenician trader bring in return for the mussel which contain the famous purple in quest of which they penetrate far into all the greek haven recent discovery present the island of cyprus the great source of copper and copper work in ancient time as the special mediator between the art of phoenicia and greece and in some archaic figure of aphrodite with her dove bring from cyprus and now in the british museumobject you might think at first sight take from the niche of a french gothic cathedralare some of the beginning at least of greek sculpture manifestly under the influence of phoenician master and again mythology be the reflex of characteristic fact it be through cyprus that the religion of aphrodite come from phoenicia to greece here in cyprus she be connect with some other kindre element of mythological tradition above all with the beautiful old story of pygmalion in which the thought of art and love be connect so closely together first of all on the prow of the phoenician ship the tutelary image of aphrodite euploea the protectress of sailor come to cyprusto cythera it be in this simple sense that she be primarily anadyomene and her connexion with the art be always an intimate one in cyprus her worship be connect with an architecture not colossal but full of dainty splendourthe art of the shrinemaker the maker of reliquary the art of the toilet the toilet of aphrodite the homeric hymn to aphrodite be full of all that delight in which we have see to be characteristic of the true homer and now we see why hephaestus that crookbacke and uncomely god be the husband of aphrodite hephaestus be the god of fire indeed as fire he be fling from heaven by zeus and in the marvellous contest between achille and the river xanthus in the twentyfirst book of the iliad he intervene in favour of the hero as mere fire against water but he soon cease to be thus generally representative of the function of fire and become almost exclusively representative of one only of its aspect its function namely in regard to early art he become the patron of smith bent with his labour at the forge as people have see such real worker he be the most perfectly develop of all the daedali mulciber or cabeiri that the god of fire become the god of all art architecture include so that he make the house of the god and be also the husband of aphrodite mark a threefold group of fact the prominence first of a peculiar kind of art in early greece that beautiful metalwork with which he be bind and bend secondly the connexion of this through aphrodite with an almost wanton personal splendour the connexion thirdly of all this with cyprus and phoenicia whence literally aphrodite come hephaestus be the of the asiatic element in greek art this then be the situation which the first period of greek art comprehend a people whose civilisation be still young delight as the young do in ornament in the sensuous beauty of ivory and gold in all the lovely production of skilled finger they receive all this together with the worship of aphrodite by way of cyprus from phoenicia from the old decrepit eastern civilisation itself long since surfeit with that splendour and they receive it in frugal quantity so frugal that their thought always go back to the east where there be the fulness of it as to a wonderland of art receive thus in frugal quantity through many generation that world of asiatic tectonic stimulate the sensuous capacity in they accustom the hand to produce and the eye to appreciate the more delicately enjoyable quality of material thing but nowhere in all this various and exquisite world of design be there as yet any adequate sense of man himself nowhere be there an insight into or power over human form as the expression of human soul yet those art of design in which that young people delight have in they already as design work that spirit of reasonable order that expressive congruity in the adaptation of mean to end of which the fully develop admirableness of human form be but the consummation a consummation already anticipate in the grand and animated figure of epic poetry their power of thought their laughter and tear under the hand of that young people as they imitate and pass largely and freely beyond those old craftsman the fire of the reasonable soul will kindle little by little up to the theseus of the parthenon and the venus of melos the ideal aim of greek sculpture as of all other art be to deal indeed with the deep element of man nature and destiny to command and express these but to deal with they in a manner and with a kind of expression as clear and graceful and simple if it may be as that of the japanese flowerpainter and what the student of greek sculpture have to cultivate generally in himself be the capacity for appreciate the expression of thought in outward form the constant habit of associate sense with soul of trace what we call expression to its source but concurrently with this he must also cultivate all along a not less equally constant appreciation of intelligent workmanship in work and of design in thing design of the rational control of matter everywhere from many source he may feed this sense of intelligence and design in the production of the minor craft above all in the various and exquisite art of japan carry a delicacy like that of nature itself into every form of imitation reproduction and combination leaf and flower fish and bird reed and waterand fail only when it touch the sacred human form that art of japan be not so unlike the early stage of greek art as might at first sight be suppose we have here and in no mere fragment the spectacle of a universal application to the instrument of daily life of fitness and beauty in a temper still unsophisticated as also unelevated by the divination of the spirit of man and at least the student must always remember that greek art be throughout a much rich and warm thing at once with more shadow and more of a dim magnificence in its surrounding than the illustration of a classical dictionary might induce he to think some of the ancient temple of greece be as rich in aesthetic curiosity as a famous modern museum that asiatic poikilia that spirit of minute and curious loveliness follow the bolder imaginative effort of greek art all through its history and one can hardly be too careful in keep up the sense of this daintiness of execution through the entire course of its development it be not only that the minute object of art the tiny vasepainte intaglio coin or cameo often reduce into the palm of the hand line grander than those of many a lifesized or colossal figure but there be also a sense in which it may be say that the venus of melos for instance be but a supremely wellexecute object of vertu in the most limited sense of the term those solemn image of the temple of theseus be a perfect embodiment of the human ideal of the reasonable soul and of a spiritual world they be also the well make thing of their kind as an urn or a cup be well make a perfect manyside development of tectonic craft a state such as the art of some nation have end in

and stir of typically noble human form quite worthily clothedamid scenery as poetic as titian if shape of colourless stone do come into that background it be as the undraped human form come into some of titians picture only to cool and solemnise its splendour the work of the greek sculptor be seldom in quite colourless stone nor always or chiefly in fastidiously select marble even but often in richly tone metal and in its consummate product chryselephantinework in gold and ivory on a core of cedar pheidia in the olympian zeus in the athene of the parthenon fulfil what that primitive heroic goldsmith age dimly discern in homer already delight in and the celebrate work of which i have first to speak now and with which greek sculpture emerge from that halfmythical age and become in a certain sense historical be a link in that goldsmith or chryselephantine tradition carry we forwards to the work of pheidia backwards to the elaborate asiatic furniture of the chamber of paris when pausania visit olympia towards the end of the second century after christ he behold among other precious object in the temple of here a splendidly wrought treasurech of cedarwood in which accord to a legend quick as usual with the true human colour the mother of cypselus have hide he when a child from the enmity of her family the bacchiadae then the nobility of corinth the child name cypselus after this incident become tyrant of corinth and his grateful descendant as it be say offer the beautiful old chest to the temple of here as a memorial of his preservation that would have be not long after the year bc so much for the story which pausania heardbut inherent probability and some point of detail in his description tend to fix the origin of the chest at a date at least somewhat later and as herodotus tell the story of the concealment of cypselus do not mention the dedication of the chest at olympia at all it may perhaps have be only one of many later imitation of antique art but whatever its date pausanias certainly see the thing and have leave a long description of it and we may trust his judgment at least as to its archaic style we have here then something plainly visible at a comparatively recent date something quite different from those perhaps wholly mythical object describe in homeran object which seem to so experience an observer as pausanias an actual work of early greek art relatively to later greek art it may have seem to he what the ancient bronze door with their scripture history which we may still see in the south transept of the cathedral of pisa be to later italian art pausania tell we nothing as to its size nor directly as to its shape it may for anything he say have be oval but it be probably rectangular with a broad front and two narrow side stand as the maker of it have design against the wall for in enumerate the various subject work upon it in five row one above another he seem to proceed begin at the bottom on the righthand side along the front from right to left and then back again through the second row from leave to right and alternate thus upwards to the last subject at the top on the lefthand side the subject represent most of which have their legend attach in difficult archaic writing be take freely though probably with a lead idea out of various poetic cycle as treat in the work of those socalle cyclic poet who continue the homeric tradition pausanias speak as homer do in his description of the shield of achille of a kind and amount of expression in feature and gesture certainly beyond the compass of any early art and we may believe we have in these touch only what the visitor hear from enthusiastic exegetae the interpreter or sacristan though any one who have see the bayeux tapestry for instance must recognise the pathos and energy of which when really prompt by genius even the early hand be capable some ingenious attempt have be make to restore the grouping of the scene with a certain formal expansion or balancing of subject their figure and dimension in true assyrian manner on the front and side we notice some fine emblematic figure the germ of great artistic motive in after time already play their part theredeath and sleep and night but what be most noticeable be as i have already say that this work like the chamber of paris like the zeus of pheidia be chryselephantine its main fabric cedar and the figure upon it partly of ivory partly of gold but partly work out of the wood of the chest itself and as we read the description we can hardly help distribute in fancy gold and ivory respectively to their appropriate function in the representation the cup of dionysus and the wing of certain horse there pausanias himself tell we be golden be not the apple of the hesperide the necklace of eriphyle the bridle the armour the unsheathed sword in the hand of amphiaraus also of gold be not the other child like the white image of sleep especially the naked child alcmaeon of ivory with alcestis and helen and that one of the dioscuri whose beard be still ungrown be not ivory and gold again combine in the throne of hercule and in the three goddess conduct before paris the fitly introduce the first historical period of greek art a period come down to about the year bc and the government of pisistratus at athens a period of tyrant like cypselus and pisistratus himself man of strong sometimes unscrupulous individuality but often also acute and cultivate patron of the art it begin with a series of invention one here and another thereinvention still for the most part technical but which be attach to single name for with the growth of art the influence of individual gift for the opening of new way more and more define itself and the school open to all comer from which in turn the disciple may pass to all part of greece take the place of the family in which the knowledge of art descend as a tradition from father to son or of the mere tradeguild of these early industry we know little but the stray notice of pausania often ambiguous always of doubtful credibility what we do see through these imperfect notice be a real period of animate artistic activity richly reward byze of naxos for instance be record as having first adopt the plan of saw marble into thin plate for use on the roof of temple instead of tile and that his name have come down to we at all testifie to the impression this fair white surface make on its first spectator various island of the aegean become each the source of some new artistic device it be a period still under the reign of hephaestus delight above all in magnificent metalwork say herodotus that be in the thirtyseventh olympiad and may be regard as characteristic of the age for the popular imagination a kind of glamour some mysterious connexion of the thing with human fortune still attach to the curious product of artistic hand to the ring of polycrate for instance with its early speciman of engrave smaragdus as to the mythical necklace of harmonia pheidon of argo first make coined money and the obeliscithe old nailshape iron money now disuse be hang up in the temple of here for even thus early the temple be in the way of become museum name like those of eucheir and eugrammus who be say to have take the art of bake clay vase from samos to etruria have still a legendary air yet may be real surname as in the case of smilis whose name be derive from a graver tool and who make the ancient image of here at samos corinthmater statuariaebecome a great nursery of art at an early time some time before the twentyninth olympiad butade of sicyon the potter settle there the record of early invention in greece be sometimes fondly colour with human sentiment or incident it be on the butterfly wing

come down to we the father fill up the outline long preserve it be believe in the nymphaeum at corinth and hence the art of model from the life in clay he learn far a way of colour his clay red and fix his mask along the temple eave the temple of athene chalcioecusathene of the brazen houseat sparta the work of gitiade celebrate about this time as architect statuary and poet who make besides the image in her shrine and besides other dorian song a hymn to the goddesswas so call from its crust or lining of bronze plate set forth in richly embossed imagery various subject of ancient legend what pausania who see it describe be like an elaborate development of that method of cover the interior of stone building with metal plate of which the at mycenae be the early historical and the house of alcinous the heroic type in the page of pausania that glitter which ulysse stand still to wonder at may still be feel and on the right hand of this he tell we stand an image of zeus also of bronze the most ancient of all image of bronze this have not be cast nor work out of a single mass of metal but the various part having be finish separately have be fit together with nail or rivet that be the early method of unite the various part of a work in metalimage or vessel or breastplatea method allow of much dainty handling of the cunning pin and rivet and one which have its place still in perfectly accomplished metalwork as in the equestrian statue of bartolomeo coleoni by andrea verrocchio in the piazza of st john and st paul at venice in the british museum there be a very early speciman of ita large eggshape vessel fit together of several piece the project pin or rivet form a sort of diadem round the middle being still sharp in form and heavily gilt that method give place in

the name of glaucus of chio a name which in connexion with this and other device for facilitate the mechanical process of artfor perfect artistic effect with economy of labourbecame proverbial the be attribute to those who work well with rapidity and ease far more fruitful still be the invention of casting of cast hollow figure especially attribute to rhoecus and theodorus architect of the great temple at samos such hollow figure able in consequence of their lightness to rest almost like an inflated bladder on a single pointthe entire bulk of a heroic rider for instance on the point of his horse tailadmit of a much free distribution of the whole weight or mass require than be possible in any other mode of statuary and the invention of the art of casting be really the discovery of liberty in composition and at last about the year bc we come to the first true school of sculptor the first clear example as we seem to discern of a communicable style reflect and interpret some real individuality in the master who evolve it convey to disciple who come to acquire it from distant place and take root through they at various centre where the name of the master became attach of course to many fair work really by the hand of the pupil dipoenus and scyllis these first true master be bear in crete but their work be connect mainly with sicyon at that time the chief seat of greek art it be say that story too as we shall see illustrate the spirit of the age for their sculpture they use the white marble of paro be worker in marble especially though they work also in ebony and in ivory and make use of gilding kedrou zôdia chrysô diênthismenapausanias say exquisitely describe a certain work of their pupil donta of lacedaemon it be to that that we have definitely come at last in the school of dipoenus and scyllis dry and brief as these detail may seem they be the witness to an active eager animate period of invention and beginning in which the greek workman triumph over the first rough mechanical difficulty which beset he in the endeavour to record what his soul conceive of the form of priest or athlete then alive upon the earth or of the everliving god then already more seldom see upon it our own fancy must fill up the story of the unrecorded patience of the workshop into which we seem to peep through these scanty noticesthe fatigue the disappointment the step repeat end at last in that moment of success which be all pausanias record somewhat uncertainly and as this period begin with the chest of cypselus so it end with a work in some respect similar also see and describe by pausaniasthe throne as he call it of the amyclaean apollo it be the work of a wellknown artist bathycle of magnesia who probably about the year bc with a company of workman come to the little ancient town of amyclae near sparta a place full of tradition of the heroic age he have be invite thither to perform a peculiar taskthe construction of a throne not like the throne of the olympian zeus and other numerous in after time for a seat figure but for the image of the local apollo no other than a rude and very ancient pillar of bronze thirty cubit high to which hermeswise head arm and foot be attach the thing stand upright as on a base upon a kind of tomb or reliquary in which accord to tradition lie the remain of the young prince hyacinth son of the founder of that place belove by apollo for his beauty and accidentally strike dead by he in play with a quoit from the drop of the lad blood have spring up the purple flower of his name which bear on its petal the letter of the ejaculation of woe and in his memory the famous game of amyclae be celebrate begin about the time of the long day when the flower be stricken by the sun and begin to fadea festival mark amid all its splendour with some real melancholy and serious thought of the dead in the midst of the of bathycle this sacred receptacle with the strange halfhumanised pillar above it be to stand probably in the open air within a consecrated enclosure like the chest of cypselus the throne be decorate with relief of subject take from epic poetry and it have support figure unfortunately what pausanias tell we of this monument hardly enable one to present it to the imagination with any completeness or certainty its dimension he himself be unable exactly to ascertain and he do not tell we its material there be reason however for supposing that it be of metal and amid these ambiguity the decoration of its base the grave or altartomb of hyacinth shine out clearly and be also for the most part clear in their significance it be as if many line of solemn thought have be mean to unite about the restingplace of this local adoni in imagery full of some dim promise of immortal life but it be not so much in care for old idol as in the making of new one that greek art be at this time engage this whole first period of greek art might indeed be call the period of graven image and all its workman son of daedalus for daedalus be the mythical or all but mythical representative of all those art which be combine in the making of lovelier idol than have heretofore be see the old greek word which be at the root of the name daedalus the name of a craft rather than a proper name probably mean to work curiouslyall curiously beautiful woodwork be daedal work the main point about the curiously beautiful chamber in which nausicaa sleep in the odyssey be that like some exquisite swiss châlet it be work in wood but it come about that those worker in wood whom daedalus represent the early craftsman of crete especially be chiefly concerned with the making of religious image like the carver of berchtesgaden and oberammergau the sort of daintily finish image of the object of public or private devotion which such workman would turn out wherever there be a wooden idol in any way fair than other finish perhaps sometimes with colour and gilding and appropriate real dress there the hand of daedalus have be that such image be quite detached from pillar or wall that they stand free and be statue in the proper sense show that greek art be already liberate from its early eastern association such freestande be apparently unknown in assyrian art and then the effect of this daedal skill in they be that they come near to the proper form of humanity it be the wonderful lifelikeness of these early image which tradition celebrate in many anecdote show a very early instinctive turn for and delight in naturalism in the greek temper as cimabue in his day be able to charm man almost as with illusion by the simple device of halfclose the eyelid of his personage and give they instead of round eye eye that seem to be in some degree sentient and to feel the light so the marvellous progress in those daedal wooden image be that the eye be open so that they seem to lookthe foot separate so that they seem to walk greek art be thus almost from the first essentially distinguish from the art of egypt by an energetic striving after truth in organic form in represent the human figure egyptian art have hold by mathematical or mechanical proportion exclusively the greek apprehend of it as the main truth that it be a live organism with freedom of movement and hence the infinite possibility of motion and of expression by motion with which the imagination credit the high sort of greek sculpture while the figure of egyptian art graceful as they often be seem absolutely incapable of any motion or gesture other than the one actually design the work of the greek sculptor together with its more real anatomy become full also of human soul that old primitive mystical first period of greek religion with its profound though halfconscious intuition of spiritual power in the natural world attach itself not to the worship of visible human form but to relic to natural or halfnatural objectsthe roughly hewn tree the unwrought stone the pillar the holy cone of aphrodite in her dimlylighte cell at paphoshad pass away the second stage in the development of greek religion have come a period in which poet and artist be busily engage in the work of incorporate all that might be retain of the vague divination of that early visionary time in definite and intelligible human image and human story the vague belief the mysterious custom and tradition develope themselves into an elaborately order ritual into personal god image in ivory and gold sit on beautiful throne always wherever a shrine or temple great or small be mention there we may conclude be a visible idol there be conceive to be the actual dwellingplace of a god and this understanding become not less but more definite as the temple become large and more splendid full of ceremony and servant like the abode of an earthly king and as the sacred presence itself assume little by little the last beauty and refinement of the visible human form and expression in what we have see of this first period of greek art in all its curious essay and invention we may observe this demand for beautiful idol increase in greecefor sacred image at first still rude and in some degree the holy for their rudeness but which yet constitute the beginning of the religious style consummate in the work of pheidia unite the veritable image of man in the full possession of his reasonable soul with the true religious mysticity the signature there of something from afar one by one these new god of bronze or marble or fleshlike ivory take their throne at this or that famous shrine like the image of this period which pausania see in the temple of here at olympiathe throne season with themis as the mother of the season and fortune and victory and kore and demeter and dionysus already visibly there around the image of here herself seat on a throne and all chryselephantine all in gold and ivory novel as these thing be they still undergo consecration at their first erect the figure of athene in her brazen temple at sparta the work of gitiade who make also the image and the hymn in triple service to the goddess and again that curious story of dipoenus and scylli bring back with so much awe to remove the public curse by complete their sacred task upon the image show how simply religious the age still wasthat this widespread artistic activity be a religious enthusiasm also those early sculptor have still for their contemporary a divine mission with some kind of hieratic or sacred quality in their gift distinctly feel the development of the artist in the proper sense out of the mere craftsman effect in the first division of this period be now complete and in close connexion with that busy graving of religious image which occupy its second division we come to something like real personality to man with individual characteristicssuch man as agelada of argos callon and onata of aegina and canachus of sicyon mere fragment as our information concern these early master be at the good it be at least unmistakeably information about man with personal difference of temper and talent of their motive of what we call style we have come to a sort of art which be no long broadly characteristic of a general period one whose product we might have look at without its occurring to we to ask concern the artist his antecedent and his school we have to do now with type of art fully impressed with the subjectivity the intimacy of the artist among these free and strong personality emerge thus about the beginning of the fifth century before christabout the period of the persian warthe name to which most of this sort of personal quality attache and which be therefore very interesting be the name of canachus of sicyon who seem to have comprehend in himself all the various attainment in art which have be gradually develop in the school of his native citycarver in wood sculptor brasscutter and toreute by toreuticê be mean the whole art of statuary in metal and in their combination with other material at last we seem to see an actual person at work and to some degree can follow with natural curiosity the motion of his spirit and his hand we seem to discern in all we know of his production the result of individual apprehensionthe result as well as the limitation of an individual talent it be impossible to date exactly the chief period of the activity of canachus that the great image of apollo which he make for the milesian be carry away to ecbatana by the persian army be state by pausania but there be a doubt whether this be under xerxes as pausania say in the year bc or twenty year early under darius so important a work as this colossal image of apollo for so great a shrine as the didymaeum be probably the task of his maturity and his career may therefore be regard as having begin at any rate prior to the year bc and the end of the persian invasion the event which may be say to close this period of art on the whole the chief period of his activity be think to have fall early and to have occupy the last forty year of the previous century and he would thus have flourish as we say about fifty year before the manhood of pheidia as mino of fiesole fifty year before the manhood of michelangelo his chief work be an aphrodite wrought for the sicyonian in ivory and gold that apollo of bronze carry away by the persian and restore to its place about the year bc and a reproduction of the same work in cedarwood for the sanctuary of apollo of the ismenus at thebe the primitive greek worship as we may trace it in homer present already on a minor scale all the essential characteristic of the most elaborate greek worship of after time the sacred enclosure the incense and other offering the prayer of the priest the shrine itselfa small one roof in by the priest with green bough not unlike a wayside chapel in modern time and understand to be the dwellingplace of the divine personwithin almost certainly an idol with its own sacred apparel a visible form little more than symbolical perhaps like the sacred pillar for which bathycle make his throne at amyclae but if an actual image certainly a rude one that primitive worship traceable in almost all these particular even in the first book of the iliad have give place before the time of canachus at sicyon to a more elaborate ritual and a more completely design imagework and a little bronze statue discover on the site of tenea where apollo be the chief object of worship the good representative of many similar marble figure those of thera and orchomenus for instanceis suppose to represent apollo as this still early age conceive himyouthful naked muscular and with the germ of the greek profile but formally smile and with a formal diadem or fillet over the long hair which show he to be no mortal athlete the hand like the foot excellently model be here extended downward at the side but in some similar figure the hand be lift and hold straight outward with the palm upturne the apollo of canachus also have the hand thus raise and on the open palm of the right hand be place a stag while with the left he grasp the bow pliny say that the stag be an automaton with a mechanical device for set it in motion a detail which hint at least at the subtlety of workmanship with which those ancient critic who have opportunity of know credit this early artist of this work itself nothing remain but we possess perhaps some imitation of it it be probably this most sacred possession of the place which the coin of miletus display from various point of view though of course only on the small scale but a little bronze figure in the british museum with the stag in the right hand and in the closed left hand the hollow where the bow have pass be think to have be derive from it and its point of style be still far illustrate by a marble head of similar character also preserve in the british museum which have many mark of having be copy in marble from an original in bronze a really ancient work or only archaic it certainly express together with all that careful patience and hardness of workmanship which be characteristic of an early age a certain apolline strengtha pride and dignity in the feature so steadily compose below the stiff archaic arrangement of the long filletbound lock it be the exact expression of that midway position between an involved archaic stiffness and the free play of individual talent which be attribute to canachus by the ancient his apollo of cedarwood which inhabit a temple near the gate of thebe on a rise ground below which flow the river ismenu have accord to pausania so close a resemblance to that at miletus that it require little skill in one who have see either of they to tell what master have design the other still though of the same dimension while one be of cedar the other be of bronze a reproduction one of the other we may believe but with the modification accord to the use of good workman even so early as canachus due to the difference of the material for the likeness between the two statue it be to be observe be not the mechanical likeness of those early image represent by the statuette of tenea which speak not of the style of one master but only of the manufacture of one workshop in those two image of canachusthe milesian apollo and the apollo of the ismenusthere be resemblance amid difference resemblance as we may understand in what be nevertheless peculiar novel and even innovate in the precise conception of the god therein set forth resemblance which speak directly of a single workman though work freely of one hand and one fancy a likeness in that which could by no means be truly copy by another it be the beginning of what we mean by the style of a master together with all the novelty the innovate and improve skill which have make canachus remember an attractive oldworld deeplyfelt mysticity seem still to cling about what we read of these early work that piety that religiousness of temper of which the people of sicyon have give proof so oddly in their dealing with those old carver scyllis and dipoenus still survive in the master who be choose to embody his own novelty of idea and execution in so sacred a place as the shrine of apollo at miletus something still conventional combine in these image with the effect of great artistic skill with a palpable beauty and power seem to have give they a really impose religious character escape from the rigid uniformity of the strict archaic style he be still obedient to certain hieratic influence and tradition he be still reserve selfcontrolle compose or even mannere a little as in some sacred presence with the severity and strength of the early style but there be certain notice which seem to show that he have his purely poetical motive also as befit his age motive which prompt work of mere fancy like his muse with the lyre symbolise the chromatic style of music aristocle his brother and agelada of argo execute each another statue to symbolise the two other order of music the ride boy of which pliny speak like the mechanical stag on the hand of apollo which he also describe be perhaps mechanical toy as benvenuto cellini make toy in the beardless aesculapius againthe image of the god of healing not merely as the son of apollo but as one ever youngit be the poetry of sculpture that we see this poetic feeling and the piety of temper so deeply impressed upon his image of apollo seem to have be combine in his chryselephantine aphrodite as we see it very distinctly in pausanias enthrone with an apple in one hand and a poppy in the other and with the sphere or polo about the head in its quaint little temple or chapel at sicyon with the hierokêpis or holy garden about it this be what canachus have to give we instead of the strange symbolical cone with the light burn around it in its dark cellthe form under which aphrodite be worship at her famous shrine of paphos pausanias tell we that be a place one would certainly have like to see so real it seemsthe seat image the people gaze through the doorway the fragrant odour must it not still be in secret keeping somewhere we be almost tempt to ask maintain by some few solitary worshipper survive from age to age among the villager of achaia in spite of many obscurity it may be say that what we know and what we do not know of canachus illustrate the amount and sort of knowledge we possess about the artist of the period which he well represent a naïvetéa freshness an earlyage simplicity and sinceritythat we may believe have we their work before we would be for we their chief aesthetic charm cicero remark that in contrast with the work of the next generation of sculptor there be a stiffness in the statue of canachus which make they seem untrue to nature but cicero belong to an age surfeit with artistic licence and likely enough to undervalue the severity of the early master the great motive struggle still with the minute and rigid hand so the critic of the last century ignore or underrate the work of the early tuscan sculptor in what cicero call of canachus combine with what we seem to see of his poetry of conception his freshness his solemnity we may understand no really repellent hardness but only that earnest patience of labour the expression of which be constant in all the good work of an early time in the david of verrocchio for instance and in the early flemish painter as it be natural and become in youth itself the very touch of the struggle hand be upon the work but with the interest the halfrepresse animation of a great promise fulfil as we now see in the magnificent growth of greek sculpture in the succeed age which however for those early workman mean the loin girt and the

its mere material and workmanship the grace of hand in it its chryselephantine character because the direction of all the more general criticism since lesse have be somewhat onesidedly towards the ideal or abstract element in greek art towards what we may call its philosophical aspect and indeed this philosophical element a tendency to the realisation of a certain inward abstract intellectual ideal be also at work in greek arta tendency which if that chryselephantine influence be call ionian may rightly be call the dorian or in reference to its broad scope the european influence and this european influence or tendency be really towards the impression of an order a sanity a proportion in all work which shall reflect the inward order of human reason now fully conscious of itselftoward a sort of art in which the record and delineation of humanity as active in the wide inward world of its passion and thought have become more or less definitely the aim of all artistic handicraft in undergo the action of these two opposing influence and by harmonise in itself their antagonism greek sculpture do but reflect the large movement of more general greek history all through greek history we may trace in every sphere of the activity of the greek mind the action of these two oppose tendenciesthe centrifugal and centripetal tendency as we may perhaps not too fancifully call they there be the centrifugal the ionian the asiatic tendency fly from the centre work with little forethought straight before it in the development of every thought and fancy throw itself forth in endless play of undirected imagination delight in brightness and colour in beautiful material in changeful form everywhere in poetry in philosophy even in architecture and its subordinate craft in the social and political order it rejoice in the free action of local and personal influence its restless versatility drive it towards the assertion of the principle of separatism of individualismthe separation of state from state the maintenance of local religion the development of the individual in that which be most peculiar and individual in he its claim be in its grace its freedom and happiness its lively interest the variety of its gift to civilisation its weakness be selfevident and be what make the unity of greece impossible it be this centrifugal tendency which plato be desirous to cure by maintain over against it the dorian influence of a severe simplification everywhere in society in culture in the very physical nature of man an enemy everywhere to variegation to what be cunning or he set himself in mythology in music in poetry in every kind of art to enforce the ideal of a sort of parmenidean abstractness and calm this exaggerated ideal of plato be however only the exaggeration of that salutary european tendency which find human mind the most absolutely real and precious thing in the world enforce everywhere the impress of its sanity its profound reflexion upon thing as they really be its sense of proportion it be the centripetal tendency which link individual to each other state to state one period of organic growth to another under the reign of a compose rational selfconscious order in the universal light of the understanding whether or not this temper so clearly traceable as a distinct influence in the course of greek development be indeed the peculiar gift of the dorian race certainly that race be the good illustration of it in its love of order of that severe composition everywhere of which the dorian style of architecture be as it be a material symbolin its constant aspiration after what be earnest and dignified as exemplify most evidently in the religion of its predilection the religion of apollo for as that ionian influence the chryselephantine influence have its patron in hephaestus belong to the religion of hephaestus husband of aphrodite the representation of exquisite workmanship of fine art in metal come from the east in close connexion with the artificial furtherance through dress and personal ornament of the beauty of the body so that dorian or european influence embody itself in the religion of apollo for the development of this or that mythological conception from its root in fact or law of the physical world be very various in its course thus demeter the spirit of life in grassand dionysus the of life in the green sap remain to the end of men thought and fancy about they almost wholly physical but apollo the of sunbeam early become exclusively ethicalthe of inward or intellectual light in all its manifestation he represent all those specially european idea of a reasonable personal freedom as understand in greece of a reasonable polity of the sanity of soul and body through the cure of disease and of the sense of sin of the perfecting of both by reasonable exercise or ascêsis his religion be a sort of embody equity its aim the realisation of fair reason and just consideration of the truth of thing everywhere i can not dwell on the general aspect of this subject far but i would remark that in art also the religion of apollo be a sanction of and an encouragement towards the true valuation of humanity in its sanity its proportion its knowledge of itself follow after this greek art attain in its reproduction of human form not merely to the profound expression of the high indwelling spirit of human intelligence but to the expression also of the great human passion of the powerful movement as well as of the calm and peaceful order of the soul as find in the affection of the body a language the element of which the artist might analyse and then combine order and recompose in relation to music to art to all those matter over which the muse preside apollo as distinct from hermes seem to be the representative and patron of what i may call reasonable music of a great intelligence at work in art of beauty attain through the conscious realisation of idea they be the city of the dorian affinity which early bring to perfection that most characteristic of greek institution the sacred dance with the whole gymnastic system which be its natural accompaniment and it be the familiar spectacle of that living sculpture which develop perhaps beyond everything else in the greek mind at its good a sense of the beauty and significance of the human form into that bewildered dazzle world of minute and dainty handicraftthe chamber of paris the house of alcinousin which the form of man alone have no adequate place and as yet properly be not this dorian european apolline influence introduce the intelligent and spiritual human presence and give it its true value a value consistently maintain to the end of greek art by a steady hold upon and preoccupation with the inward harmony and system of human personality in the work of the asiatic traditionthe marble of nineveh for instanceand so far as we can see in the early greek art which derive from it as for example in the archaic remain from cyprus the form of man be inadequate and below the measure of perfection attain there in the representation of the low form of life just as in the little reflective art of japan so lovely in its reproduction of flower or bird the human form alone come almost as a caricature or be at least untouched by any high ideal to that asiatic tradition then with its perfect craftsmanship its consummate skill in design its power of hand the dorian the european the true hellenic influence bring a revelation of the soul and body of man and we come at last in the marble of aegina to a monument which bear upon it the full expression of this humanismto a work in which the presence of man realise with complete mastery of hand and with clear apprehension of how he actually be and move and look be touch with the fresh sense of that newfound inward value the energy of worthy passion purify the light of his reason shine through bodily form and motion solemnise attractive pathetic we have reach an extant work real and visible of an importance out of all proportion to anything actually remain of early art and justifying by its direct interest and charm our long prelude on the beginning of greek sculpture while there be still almost nothing actually to see these fifteen figure of parian marble of about twothird the size of life form with some deficiency the east and west gable of a temple of athene the ruin of which still stand on a hillside by the seashore in a remote part of the island of aegina be discover in the year and having be purchase by the crown prince afterwards king louis i of bavaria be now the great ornament of the glyptothek or museum of sculpture at munich the group in each gable consist of eleven figure and of the fifteen large figure discover five belong to the eastern ten to the western gable so that the western gable be complete with the exception of one figure which should stand in the place to which as the group be arrange at munich the beautiful figure bend down towards the fall leader have be actually transfer from the eastern gable certain fragment show that the lose figure correspond essentially to this which have therefore be remove hither from its place in the less complete group to which it properly belong for there be two legitimate view or motive in the restoration of ancient sculpture the antiquarian and the aesthetic as they may be term respectively the former limit itself to the bare presentation of what actually remain of the ancient work brave all shock to live eye from the mutilated nose or chin while the latter the aesthetic method require that with the least possible addition or interference by the most skilful live hand procurable the object shall be make to please or at least content the live eye seek enjoyment and not a bare fact of science in the spectacle of ancient art this latter way of restorationthe aesthetic wayfollowe by the famous connoisseur of the renaissance have be follow here and the visitor to munich actually see the marble of aegina as restore after a model by the tasteful hand of thorwaldsen different view have however be maintain as to the right grouping of the figure but the composition of the two group be apparently similar not only in general character but in a certain degree of correspondence of all the figure each to each and in both the subject be a combata combat between greek and asiatic concern the body of a greek hero fall among the foemenan incident so characteristic of the poetry of the heroic war in both case athene whose temple this sculpture be design to decorate intervene her image be complete in the western gable the head and some other fragment remain of that in the eastern the incident represent be probably choose with reference to the tradition of aegina in connexion with the trojan war greek legend be ever deeply colour by local interest and sentiment and this monument probably celebrate telamon and ajax his son the hero who establish the fame of aegina and whom the united greeks on the morning of the battle of salamis in which the aeginetan be distinguish above all other greek in bravery invite as their peculiar spiritual ally from that island accordingly antiquarian be for the most part of opinion that the eastern gable represent the combat of hercule and of his comrade telamon against laomedon of troy in which properly hercule be leader but here as squire and archer be make to give the first place to telamon as the titular hero of the place opinion be not so definite regard the subject of the western gable which however probably represent the combat between the greek and trojan over the body of patroclus in both case an aeginetan hero in the eastern gable telamon in the western his son ajax be represent in the extreme crisis of battle such a crisis as accord to the deep religiousness of the greek of that age be a motive for the visible intervention of the goddess in favour of her choose people opinion as to the date of the work base mainly on the characteristic of the work itself have vary within a period range from the middle of the sixtieth to the middle of the seventieth olympiad incline on the whole to the later date in the period of the ionian revolt against persia and a few year early than the battle of marathon in this monument then we have a revelation in the sphere of art of the temper which make the victory of marathon and salamis possible of the true spirit of greek chivalry as display in the persian war and in the highly ideal conception of its event express in herodotus and approve itself minutely to the mind of the greek as a series of affair in which the god and hero of old time personally intervene and that not as mere shadow it be natural that the highpitched temper the stress of thought and feeling which end in the final conflict of greek liberty with asiatic barbarism should stimulate quite a new interest in the poetic legend of the early conflict between they in the heroic age as the event of the crusade and the chivalrous spirit of that period lead men mind back to ponder over the deed of charlemagne and his paladin give birth to the composition of the song of roland just so this aeginetan sculpture display the greek of a later age feed their enthusiasm on the legend of a distant past and be a link between herodotus and homer in those ideal figure pensive a little from the first we may suppose with the shadowiness of a past age we may yet see how greek of the time of themistocle really conceive of homeric knight and squire some other fragment of art also discover in aegina and suppose to be contemporary with the temple of athene tend by their roughness and immaturity to show that this small building so united in its effect so complete in its simplicity in the symmetry of its two main group of sculpture be the perfect artistic flower of its time and place yet within the limit of this simple unity so important an element in the charm and impressiveness of the place a certain inequality of design and execution may be detect the hand of a slightly early master probably having work in the western gable while the master of the eastern gable have go some step far than he in fineness and power of expression the stoop figure of the suppose ajaxbelonging to the western group in the present arrangement but really borrow as i say from the easternwhich have in it something above the type of the figure group round it be this later sculptor work yet overbeck who have elaborate the point of this distinction of style commend without reserve the technical excellence of the whole work execute as he say it be the dorian city plato tell we which first shake off the false asiatic shame and strip off their clothing for purpose of exercise and training in the gymnasium and it be part of the dorian or european influence to assert the value in art of the unveiled and healthy human form and here the artist of aegina notwithstanding homer description of greek armour glow like the sun itself have display the greek warriorsgreek and trojan alikenot in the equipment they would really have wear but nakedflesh fairer than that golden armour though more subdued and tranquil in effect on the spectator the undraped form of man come like an embodiment of the hellenic spirit and as an element of temperance into the somewhat gaudy spectacle of asiatic or archaic art paris alone bear his dainty trapping characteristicallya coat of golden scalework the scale set on a lining of canvas or leather shift deftly over the delicate body beneath and represent on the gable by the gilding or perhaps by real gilt metal it be characteristic also of that more truly hellenic artanother element of its temperanceto adopt the use of marble in its work and the material of these figure be the white marble of paro trace of colour have however be find on certain part of they the outer surface of the shield and helmet have be blue their inner part and the crest of the helmet red the hem of the drapery of athene the edge of her sandal the plinth on which the figure stand also red one quiver red another blue the eye and lip too colour perhaps the hair there be just a limited and conventionalise use of colour in effect upon the marble and although the actual material of these figure be marble its coolness and massiveness suit the grow severity of greek think yet they have their reminiscence of work in bronze in a certain slimness and tenuity a certain dainty lightness of poise in their grouping which remain in the memory as a peculiar note of their style the possibility of such easy and graceful balancing be one of the privilege or opportunity of statuary in cast metal of that hollow casting in which the whole weight of the work be so much less than that of a work of equal size in marble and which permit so much wide and free a disposition of the part about its centre of gravity in aegina the tradition of metalwork seem to have be strong and onatas whose name be closely connect with aegina and who be contemporary with the presumably later portion of this monument be above all a worker in bronze here again in this lurk spirit of metalwork we have a new element of complexity in the character of these precious remain and then to compass the whole work in our imagination we must conceive yet another element in the conjoint effect metal being actually mingle with the marble bring thus to its dainty point of refinement as the little hole indicate bore into the marble figure for the attachment of certain accessory in bronzelance sword bow the medusas head on the aegis of athene and its fringe of little snake and as there be no adequate consciousness and recognition of the essential of man nature in the old oriental art so there be no pathos no humanity in the more special sense but a kind of hardness and cruelty rather in those oftrepeate long matteroffact procession on the marble of nineveh of slavelike soldier on their way to battle mechanically or of captive on their way to slavery or death for the satisfaction of the great king these greek marble on the contrary with that figure yearn forward so graciously to the fallen leader be deeply impressed with a natural pathetic effectthe true reflexion again of the temper of homer in speak of war are the god of war himself we must remember be accord to his original import the god of storm of winter rage among the forest of the thracian mountain a brother of the north wind it be only afterwards that survive many minor god of war he become a leader of host a sort of divine knight and patron of knighthood and through the old intricate connexion of love and war and that amorousness which be the universally concede privilege of the soldier life he come to be very near aphroditethe paramour of the goddess of physical beauty so that the idea of a sort of soft dalliance mingle in his character so unlike that of the christian leader saint george with the idea of savage warlike impulse the fair soft creature suddenly rage like a storm to which in its various wild incident war be constantly liken in homer the effect of delicate youth and of tempest blend in are into one expression not without that cruelty which mingle also like the influence of some malign fate upon he with the fine characteristic of achille who be a kind of merely human double of are and in homer impression of war the same element be blentthe delicacy the beauty of youth especially which make it so fit for purpose of love spoil and waste by the random flood and fire of a violent tempest the glitter beauty of the greek express in so many brilliant figure and the splendour of their equipment in collision with the miserable accident of battle and the grotesque indignity of death in it bring home to our fancy by a hundred pathetic incidentsthe sword hot with slaughter the stifle blood in the throat the spoiling of the body in every member severally he think of and record at his early end the distant home from which the boy come who goes stumble now just stricken so wretchedly his bowel in his hand he push the expression of this contrast to the macabre even suggest the approach of those low form of life which await to morrow the fair body of the hero who strive and fall today like these in the aeginetan gable for it be just that twofold sentiment which this sculpture have embody the seemingly strong hand which work the eastern gable have show itself strong in the rigid expression of the truth of pain in the mouth of the famous recumbent figure on the extreme leave the lip just open at the corner and in the hardshut lip of hercule otherwise these figure all smile faintly almost like the monumental effigy of the middle age with a smile which even if it be but a result of the mere conventionality of an art still somewhat immature have just the pathetic effect of homer conventional epithet when he speak of the flesh of his hero and together with this touching power there be also in this work the effect of an early simplicity the charm of its limitation for as art which have pass its prime have sometimes the charm of an absolute refinement in taste and workmanship so immature art also as we now see have its own attractiveness in the naïveté the freshness of spirit which find power and interest in simple motive of feeling and in the freshness of hand which have a sense of enjoyment in mechanical process still perform unmechanically in the spending of care and intelligence on every touch as regard italian art the sculpture and painting of the early renaissance the aesthetic value of this naïveté be now well understand but it have its value in greek sculpture also there too be a succession of phase through which the artistic power and purpose grow to maturity with the endure charm of an unconventional unsophisticated freshness in that very early stage of it illustrate by these marble of aegina not less than in the work of verrocchio and mino of fiesole effect of this we may note in that sculpture of aegina not merely in the simplicity or monotony even of the whole composition and in the exact and formal correspondence of one gable to the other but in the simple readiness with which the designer make the two second spearman kneel against the probability of the thing so as just to fill the space he have to compose in the profile be still not yet of the fully develop greek type but have a somewhat sharp prominence of nose and chin as in etrurian design in the early sculpture of cyprus and in the early greek vase and the general proportion of the body in relation to the shoulder be still somewhat archaically slim but then the workman be at work in dry earnestness with a sort of hard strength in detail a scrupulousness verging on stiffness like that of an early flemish painter he communicate to we his still youthful sense of pleasure in the experience of the first rudimentary difficulty of his art overcome and withal these figure have in they a true expression of life of animation in this monument of greek chivalry pensive and visionary as it may seem those old greek knight live with a truth like that of homer or chaucer in a sort of stiff grace combine with a sense of thing bright or sorrowful directly feel the aeginetan workman be as it be the chaucer of greek sculpture the age of athletic prizeman a chapter in greek art it be pleasant when look at medieval sculpture we be remind of that of greece pleasant likewise conversely in the study of greek work to be put on thought of the middle age to the refined intelligence it would seem there be something attractive in complex expression as such the marble of aegina then may remind we of the middle age where it pass into the early renaissance of its most tenderly finish warriortomb at westminster or in florence a less mature phase of medieval art be recall to our fancy by a primitive greek work in the museum of athens herme bear a ram a little one upon his shoulder he bear it thus have bear it round the wall of tanagra as its citizen tell by way of purify that place from the plague and bring to mind of course later image of the it be not the subject of the work however but its style that set we down in thought before some gothic cathedral front suppose the hermes kriophorus lift into one of those empty niche and the archaeologist will inform you rightly as at auxerre or well of italian influence perhaps of italian workman and along with they indirect old greek influence come northward while the connoisseur assure we that all good art at its respective stage of development be in essential quality everywhere alike it be observe as a note of imperfect skill that in that carve block of stone the animal be insufficiently detach from the shoulder of its bearer again how precisely gothic be the effect its very limitation as sculpture emphasise the function of the thing as an architectural ornament and the student of the middle age if it come within his range would be right in so esteem it hieratic stiff and formal if you will there be a knowledge of the human body in it nevertheless of the body and of the purely animal soul therein full of the promise of what be come in that chapter of greek art which may properly be entitle that rude image a work perhaps of calamis of shadowy fame belong to a phase of art still in graveclothe or swaddlingband still strictly subordinate to religious or other purpose not immediately its own it have scarcely to wait for the next generation to be supersede and we need not wonder that but little of it remain but that it be a widely active phase of art with all the vigour of local variety be attest by another famous archaic monument too full of a kind of sacred poetry to be pass by the reader do not need to be remind that the greek vivid as be their consciousness of this life care much always for the grave of the dead that to be care for to be honour in one grave to have tymbo amphipolo a frequented tomb as pindar say be a considerable motive with they even among the young in the study of its funeral monument we might indeed follow closely enough the general development of art in greece from begin to end the carve slab of the ancient shepherd of orchomenus with his dog and rustic staff the stélé of the ancient manatarm sign rich originally with colour and gold and fitting of bronze be among the few still visible picture or portrait it may be of the early greek life compare they compare their expression for a moment with the deeply incise tombstone of the brother of st francis and their client which still roughen the pavement of santa croce at florence and recall the varnished polychrome decoration of those greek monument in connexion with the wornout blazonry of the funeral brass of england and flander the shepherd the hoplite begin a series continuous to the era of full attic mastery in its gentle mood with a large and varied store of memorial of the dead which not so strangely as it may seem at first sight be like select page from daily domestic life see for instance at the british museum trypho one of the very pleasant human likeness there though it come from a cemeterya son it be hard to leave in it at nineteen or twenty with all the suppleness the delicate muscularity of the flower of his youth his handsome face sweeten by a kind and simple heart in motion surely he step forth from some shadowy chamber strigil in hand as of old and with his coarse towel or cloak of monumental drapery over one shoulder but whither precisely you may ask and as what be he move there in the doorway well in effect certainly it be the memory of the dead lad emerge thus from his tombthe still active soul or permanent thought of he as he most like to be the harpy tomb so call from its mysterious wing creature with human face carry the little shrouded soul of the dead be a work many generation early than that graceful monument of trypho it be from an ancient cemetery at xanthus in lycia that it come to the british museum the lycian be not a greek people but as happen even with dwelling on the coast of asia minor they become lover of the hellenic culture and xanthus their capital as may be judge from the beauty of its ruin manage to have a considerable portion in greek art though infuse it with a certain asiatic colour the frugally design frieze of the harpy tomb in the low possible relief might fairly be place between the monument of assyria and those primitive greek work among which it now actually stand the stiffly range figure in any other than strictly archaic work would seem affect but what an undercurrent of refined sentiment presumably not asiatic not lift those who feel thus about death so early into the main stream of greek humanity and to a level of visible refinement in execution duly expressive of it in that old burialplace of xanthus then a now nameless family or a single bereaved member of it represent there as a diminutive figure crouch on the earth in sorrow erect this monument so full of family sentiment and of so much value as illustrate what be for we a somewhat empty period in the history of greek art strictly so call like the less conspicuously adorn tomb around it like the tomb in homer it have the form of a towera square tower about twentyfour foot high hollow at the top into a small chamber for the reception through a little doorway of the urned ashe of the dead four sculptured slab be place at this level on the four side of the tower in the manner of a frieze i say that the wing creature with human face carry the little soul of the dead the interpretation of these mystic imagery be in truth debate but in face of they and remember how the sculptor and glasspainter of the middle age constantly represent the soul of the dead as tiny body one can hardly doubt as to the meaning of these particular detail which repeat on every side seem to give the keynote of the whole composition those infernal or celestial bird indeed be not true to what be understand to be the harpy form call they siren rather people and not only old people as you know appear sometimes to have be quite charm away by what dismay most of we the tiny shroud figure which the siren carry be carry very tenderly and seem to yearn in their turn towards those kindly nurse as they pass on their way to a new world their small stature as i say do not prove they infant but only newborn into that other life and contrast their helplessness with the power the great presence now around they a cow far enough from myron famous illusive animal suckle her calf she be one of almost any number of artistic symbol of newbirth of the renewal of life draw from a world which be after all so full of it on one side sit enthrone as some have think the goddess of death on the opposite side the goddess of life with her flower and fruit towards her three young maiden be advancingwere they still alive thus graceful virginal with their long plait hair and long delicatelyfolde tunic look forward to carry on their race into the future present severally on the other side of the dark hollow within three male personsa young man an old man and a boyseem to be bring home somewhat wearily to their the young man his armour the boy and the old man like old socrate the mortuary cock as they approach some shadowy ancient deity of the tomb or it may be the throne impersonation of their the marble surface be colour at least in part with fixture of metal here and there the designer whoever he may have be was possess certainly of some tranquillising second thought concern death which may well have have their value for mourner and he have express those thought if lispingly yet with no fault of commission with a befit grace and in truth at some point with something already of a really hellenic definition and vigour he really speak to we in his work through his symbolic and imitative figuresspeak to our intelligence persuasively the survive thought of the lad trypho return from his tomb to the living be of athletic character how he be and look when in the flower of his strength and it be not of the dead but of the living who look and be as he that the artistic genius of this period be full it be a period truly not of battle such as those commemorate in the marble of aegina but of more peaceful contest at olympia at the isthmus at delphithe glory of which pindar sing in language suggestive of a sort of metallic beauty firmly cut and emboss like crown of wild olive of parsley and bay in crisp gold first however it have be necessary that greece should win its liberty political standingground and a really social air to breathe in with development of the youthful limb of this process athens be the chief scene and the early notable presentment of humanity by athenian art be in celebration of those who have vindicate liberty with their livestwo youth again in a real incident which have however the quality of a poetic invention turn as it do on that ideal or romantic friendship which be characteristic of the greek with something perhaps of hieratic convention yet present as they really be as friend and admirer love to think of they harmodius and aristogeiton stand then soon after their heroic death side by side in bronze the work of antenor in a way not to be forget when thirty year afterwards a foreign tyrant xerxe carry they away to persia kritio and nesiste be therefore employ for a reproduction of they which would naturally be somewhat more advanced in style in its turn this also disappear the more curious student however would still fancy he see the trace of itof that copy or of the original afterwards restore to athenshere or there on vase or coin but in fact the very image of the heroic youth be become but ghost haunt the story of greek art till they find or seem to find a body once more when not many year since an acute observer detect as he think in a remarkable pair of statue in the museum of naples if free from incorrect restoration and rightly set together a veritable descendant from the original work of antenor with all their truth to physical form and movement with a conscious mastery of delineation they be nevertheless in certain detail in the hair for instance archaic or rather archaisticdesignedly archaic as from the hand of a workman for whom in this subject archaism the very touch of the ancient master have a sentimental or even a religious value and unmistakeably they be young assassin move with more than fraternal unity the young in advance of and cover the elder accord to the account give by herodotus straight to their purposeagainst two wicked brother as you remember two good friend on behalf of the dishonoured sister of one of they archaeologist have love to adjust they tentatively with various hypothesis as to the precise manner in which they thus go together meantime they have figure plausibly as representative of attic sculpture at the end of its first period still immature indeed but with a just claim to take breath so to speak having now accomplish some stade of the journey those young hero of athenian democracy then indicate already what place athens and attica will occupy in the supreme age of art soon to come indicate also the subject from which that age will draw the main stream of its inspirationliving youth in its exact portraiture or as idealise in various degree under the influence of great thought about ityouth in its selfdenye contention towards great effect great intrinsically as at marathon or when harmodius and aristogeiton fall or magnify by the force and splendour of greek imagination with the stimulus of the national game for the most part indeed it be not with youth tax spasmodically like that of harmodius and aristogeiton and the that be upon it that the athenian mind and heart be now busied but with youth in its voluntary labour its habitual and measured discipline labour for its own sake or in wholly friendly contest for prize which in reality borrow all their value from the quality of the receiver we be with pindar you see in this athletic age of greek sculpture it be the period no long of battle against a foreign foe recall the homeric ideal nor against the tyrant at home fix a dubious ideal for the future but of peaceful combat as a fine artpulvis olympicus anticipate the art poetry a generation before myron and polycleitus have draw already from the youthful combatant in the great national game the motive of those ode the brace word of which as i say be like work in fine bronze or as pindar himself suggest in ivory and gold sing in the victor supper room or at the door of his abode or with the lyre and the pipe as they take he home in procession through the street or commemorate the happy day or in a temple where he lay up his crown pindar song bear witness to the pride of family or township in the physical perfection of son or citizen and his consequent success in the long or the short footrace or the footrace in armour or the pentathlon or any part of it as the poet tell ariston hydôr he declare indeed and the actual prize as we know be in itself of little or no wortha cloak in the athenian game but at the great game a mere handful of parsley a few sprig of pine or wild olive the prize have so to say only an intellectual or moral value yet actually pindar own verse be all of gold and wine and flower be itself avowedly a flower or or the keynote of pindars verse be there this brilliant live youth of his day of the actual time for whom as he say he epeôn hoimon ligynthat song mingle sometimes with the splendour of a record ancient lineage or with the legendary greatness of a remoter past its god and hero patron or ancestor it might be of the famous young man of the hour or with the glory and solemnity of the immortal themselves take a share in mortal contest on such pretext he will tell a new story or bring to its last perfection by his manner of tell it his pregnancy and study beauty of expression an old one the tale of castor and polydeuke the appropriate patron of virginal yet virile youth star and mount he tell in all its human interest and what pindar contemporary ask of he for the due appreciation the consciousness of it by way of song that the next generation seek by way of sculptural memorial in marble and above all as it seem in bronze the keen demand for athletic statuary the honour attach to the artist employ to make his statue at olympia or at home bear witness again to the pride with which a greek town the pathos it might be with which a family look back to the victory of one of its member in the court of olympia a whole population in marble and bronze gather quicklya world of portrait out of which as the purge and perfect essence the ideal soul of they emerge the diadumenus for instance the discobolus the socalled jason of the louvre olympia be in truth as pindar say again a mother of goldcrowned contest the mother of a large offspring all over greece the enthusiasm for gymnastic for the life of the gymnasia prevail it be a gymnastic which under the happy condition of that time be already surely what plato plead for already one half music mousikê a matter partly of character and of the soul of the fair proportion between soul and body of the soul with itself who can doubt it who see and consider the still irresistible grace the contagious pleasantness of the discobolus the diadumenus and a few other precious survival from the athletic age which immediately precede the manhood of pheidia between the persian and the peloponnesian war now this predominance of youth of the youthful form in art of bodily gymnastic promote natural advantage to the utmost of the physical perfection develop thereby be a sign that essential mastery have be achieve by the artistthe power that be to say of a full and free realisation for such youth in its very essence be a matter properly within the limit of the visible the empirical world and in the presentment of it there will be no place for symbolic hint none of that reliance on the helpful imagination of the spectator the legitimate scope of which be a large one when art be deal with religious object with what in the fulness of its own nature be not really expressible at all in any passable representation of the greek discobolus as in any passable representation of an english cricketer there can be no successful evasion of the natural difficulty of the thing to be donethe difficulty of compete with nature itself or its maker in that marvellous combination of motion and rest of inward mechanism with the so smoothly finish surface and outlinefinished ad unguem which enfold it of the gradual development of such mastery of natural detail a veritable counterfeit of nature the veritable rhythmus of the runner for exampletwinkle heel and ivory shoulderwe have hint and trace in the historian of art one have attain the very turn and texture of the crisp lock another the very feel of the tense nerve and fullflushe vein while with another you see the bosom of ladas expand the lip part as if for a last breath ere he reach the goal it be like a child find little by little the use of its limb the testimony of its sense at a definite moment with all its poetic impulse it be an age clearly of faithful observation of what we call realism alike in its iconic and heroic work alike in portraiture that be to say and in the presentment of divine or abstract type its workman be close student now of the living form as such aim with success at an ever large and more various expression of its detail or replace a conventional statement of they by a real and lively one that it be thus be attest indirectly by the fact that they busy themselves seemingly by way of a tour de force and with no essential interest in such subject alien as it be from the pride of health which be characteristic of the gymnastic life with the expression of physical pain in philoctete for instance the adroit the swift the strong in full and free exercise of their gift to the delight of other and of themselves though their sculptural record have for the most part perish be specify in ancient literary notice as the sculptor favourite subject repeat remodelle over and over again for the adornment of the actual scene of athletic success or the marketplace at home of the distant northern or sicilian town whence the prizeman have comea countless series of popular illustration to pindar ode and if art be still to minister to the religious sense it could only be by clothing celestial spirit also as nearly as possible in the bodily semblance of the various athletic combatant whose patron respectively they be suppose to be the age to which we be come in the story of greek art present to we indeed only a chapter of scatter fragment of name that be little more with but surmise of their original significance and mere reasoning as to the sort of art that may have occupy what be really empty space two name however connect themselves gloriously with certain extant work of art copy it be true at various remove yet copy of what be still find delightful through they and by copyist who for the most part be themselves master through the variation of the copyist the restorer the mere imitator these work be reducible to two famous original typesthe discobolus or quoitplayer of myron the beau idéal of athletic motion and the diadumenus of polycleitus as bind the fillet or crown of victory upon his head he present the beau idéal of athletic repose and almost begin to think myron be a native of eleutherae and a pupil of agelada of argo there be nothing more to tell by way of positive detail of this so famous artist save that the main scene of his activity be athens now become the centre of the artistic as of all other mode of life in greece multiplicasse veritatem videtur say pliny he be in fact an earnest realist or naturalist and rise to central perfection in the portraiture the idealise portraiture of athletic youth from a mastery first of all in the delineation of inferior object of little lifeless or living thing think however for a moment how win such object be still as present on greek coinsthe ear of corn for instance on those of metapontum the microscopic cockleshell the dolphin on the coin of syracuse myron then pass from pleasant truth of that kind to the delineation of the worthy sort of animal lifethe ox the dog to nothing short of illusion in the treatment of they as ancient connoisseur would have you understand it be say that there be thirtysix extant epigram on his brazen cow that animal have her gentle place in greek art from the siren tomb suckle her young there as the type of eternal rejuvenescence onwards to the procession of the elgin frieze where still breathe deliciously of the distant pasture she be lead to the altar we feel sorry for she as we look so lifelike be the carve marble the sculptor who work there whoever he may have be have profit doubtless by the study of myron famous work for what purpose he make it do not appearas an architectural ornament or a votive offering perhaps only because he like make it in hyperbolic epigram at any rate the animal breathe explain sufficiently the point of plinys phrase regard myroncorporum curiosus and when he come to his main business with the quoitplayer the wrestler the runner he do not for a moment forget that they too be animal young animal delight in natural motion in free course through the yield air over uninterrupted space accord to aristotle definition of pleasure corporum tenus curiosushe be a as far as the live body be concerned pliny go on to qualify that phrase by say that he do not express the sensation of the mind animi sensus but just there in fact precisely in such limitation we find what authenticate myron peculiar value in the evolution of greek art it be of the essence of the athletic prizeman involve in the very ideal of the quoitplayer the cricketer not to give expression to mind in any antagonism to or invasion of the body to mind as anything more than a function of the body whose healthful balance of function it may so easily perturbto disavow that insidious enemy of the fairness of the bodily soul as such yet if the art of myron be but little occupy with the reasonable soul with those mental situation the expression of which though it may have a pathos and a beauty of its own be for the most part adverse to the proper expression of youth to the beauty of youth by cause it to be no long youthful he be certainly a master of the animal or physical soul there how it be how it display itself as illustrate for instance in the discobolus of voluntary animal motion the very soul be undoubtedly there we have but translation into marble of the original in bronze in that it be as if a blast of cool wind have congeal the metal or the live youth fix he imperishably in that moment of rest which lie between two oppose motion the backward swing of the right arm the movement forward on which the left foot be in the very act of start the matter of the thing the stately bronze or marble thus rest indeed but the artistic form of it in truth scarcely more even to the eye than the roll ball or disk may be say to rest at every moment of its coursejust metaphysically you know this mystery of combine motion and rest of rest in motion have involve of course on the part of the sculptor who have master its secret long and intricate consideration archaic as it be primitive still in some respect full of the primitive youth it celebrate it be in fact a learn work and suggest to a great analyst of literary style singular as it may seem the or manner in literature of the later latin writer which however he find for its purpose yet with all its learn involution thus so oddly characterise by quintilian so entirely be this quality subordinate to the proper purpose of the discobolus as a work of art a thing to be look at rather than to think about that it make one exclaim still with the poet of athletesthe natural be ever bestgrant they the face of the young man as you see he in the british museum for instance with fittingly inexpressive expression be beautiful but not altogether virile the eye the facial line which they gather into one seem ready to follow the come motion of the discus as those of an onlooker might be but that head do not really belong to the discobolus to be assure of this you have but to compare with that version in the british museum the most authentic of all derivation from the original preserve till lately at the palazzo massimi in rome here the vigorous head also with the face smooth enough but spare and tightly draw over muscle and bone be sympathetic with yield itself to the concentration in the most literal sense of all besideis itself in very truth the steady centre of the discus which begin to spin as the source of will the source of the motion with which the discus be already on the wingthat and the entire form the discobolus of the massimi palace present moreover in the hair for instance those survival of primitive manner which would mark legitimately myron actual pre pheidiac standpoint as they be congruous also with a certain archaic a more than merely athletic spareness of form generally delightful touch of unreality in this realist of a great time and of a sort of conventionalism that have an attraction in itself be it a portrait that one can so much as ask the question be a proof how far the master in spite of his linger archaism be come already from the antique marble of aegina be it the portrait of one muchadmired youth or rather the type the rectify essence of many such at the most pregnant the essential moment of the exercise of their natural power of what they really be have we here in short the sculptor myron reason memory of many a quoit player of a long flight of quoitplayer as be he here he might have give we the cricketer the pass generation of cricketer sub specie eternitatis under the eternal form of art be it in that case a commemorative or votive statue such as pausania find scatter throughout greece be it again design to be part only of some large decorative scheme as some have suppose of the venus of melos or a work of genre as we say a thing intend merely to interest to gratify the taste with no further purpose in either case it may have represent some legendary quoitplayerperseus at play with acrisius fatally as one have suggest or apollo with hyacinthus as ovid describe he in a work of poetic genre and if the discobolus be after all a work of genrea work merely imitative of the detail of actual lifefor the adornment of a room in a private house it would be only one of many such produce in myron day it would be in fact one of the pristae directly attribute to he by pliny little congruous as they may seem with the grandiose motion of his more characteristic work the pristae the sawyersa celebrate creation of the kindi suppose to have give its name to the whole class of like thing no age indeed since the rudiment of art be master can have be without such reproduction of the pedestrian incident of every day for the mere pleasant exercise at once of the curiosity of the spectator and the imitative instinct of the producer the terra cotta room of the louvre and the british museum be a proof of it one such work indeed there be delightful in itself technically exquisite most interesting by its history which properly find its place beside the large the fullgrown physical perfection of the discobolus one of whose alert young brother he may bethe spinario namely the boy draw a thorn from his foot preserve in the so rare veritable antique bronze at rome in the museum of the capitol and well know in a host of ancient and modern reproduction there or elsewhere in rome tolerate in the general destruction of ancient sculpturelike the allow by way of heraldic sign as in modern siena or like the equestrian figure of marcus aurelius do duty as charlemagnelike those but like very few other work of the kind the spinario remain wellknown and in honour throughout the middle age story like that of ladas the famous runner who die as he reach the goal in a glorious foot race of boy the subject of a famous work by myron himself be tell of the halfgrown bronze lad at the capitol of necessity but fatally he must pause for a few moment in his course or the course be at length over or the breathless journey with some allimportant tiding and now not till now he think of rest to draw from the sole of his foot the cruel thorn drive into it as he run in any case there he still sit for a moment for ever amid the smile admiration of century in the agility in the perfect naïveté also as thus occupy of his sixteenth year to which the somewhat lengthy or attenuate structure of the limb be conformable and then in this attenuation in the almost egyptian proportion in the shallowness of the chest and shoulder especially in the phoenician or old greek sharpness and length of profile and the long conventional wiredrawn hair of the boy arch formally over the forehead and round the neck there be something of archaism of that archaism which survive truly in myron own work blend with the grace and power of wellnigh the maturity of greek art the blending of interest of artistic alliance be certainly delightful polycleitus the other famous name of this period and with a fame justify by work we may still study at least in its immediate derivative have also try his hand with success in such subject in the astragalizonte for instance well known to antiquity in countless reproduction he have treat an incident of the everyday life of every age which plato sketch by the way myron by patience of genius have master the secret of the expression of movement have pluck out the very heart of its mystery polycleitus on the other hand be above all the master of rest of the expression of rest after toil in the victorious and crown athlete diadumenus in many slightly vary form marble version of the original in bronze of delo the diadumenus indifferently mechanically be bind round his head a ribbon or fillet in the vaison copy at the british museum it be of silver that simple fillet be in fact a diadem a crown and he assume it as a victor but as i say mechanically and prize in hand might be ask himself whether after all it have be worth while for the active beauty of the agoniste of which myron art be full we have here then the passive beauty of the victor but the later incident the realisation of rest be actually in affinity with a certain earliness so to call it in the temper and work of polycleitus he be already something of a reactionary or pause rather to enjoy to convey enjoyably to other the full savour of a particular moment in the development of his craft the moment of the perfecting of restful form before the mere consciousness of technical mastery in delineation urge forward the art of sculpture to a bewildering infinitude of motion in opposition to the ease the freedom of other his aim be by a voluntary restraint in the exercise of such technical mastery to achieve nothing less than the impeccable within certain narrow limit he still hesitate be selfexacte seem even to have check a grow readiness of hand in the artist about he he be renowne as a graver find much to do with the chisel introduce many a fine afterthought when the roughcasting of his work be over he study human form under such condition as would bring out its natural feature its static law in their entirety their harmony and in an academic work so to speak no long to be clearly identify in what may be derivation from it he claim to have fix the canon the common measure of perfect man yet with polycleitus certainly the measure of man be not yet but still only that of mortal youth of youth however in that scrupulous and uncontaminate purity of form which recommend itself even to the greek as befit messenger from the god if such messenger should come and yet a large part of myron contemporary fame depend on his religious workon his statue of here for instance in ivory and goldthat too doubtless expressive as appropriately to its subject as to himself of a passive beauty we see it still perhaps in the coin of argo and have not the crown victor too in that mechanic action in his demure attitude something which remind we of the religious significance of the greek athletic service it be a sort of worship you knowthat department of public life such worship as greece still in its superficial youth find itself well capable of at least those solemn contest begin and end with prayer and sacrifice their most honoured prize be a kind of religiously symbolical object the athletic life certainly breathe of abstinence of rule and the keeping under of one self and here in the diadumenus we have one of its priest a priest of the religion whose central motive be what have be call its modest priest the socalled jason at the louvre the apoxyomenus and a certain number of other you will meet with from time to timewhatever be the age and derivation of the actual marble which reproduce for rome for africa or gaul type that can have have their first origin in one only time and placebelong at least aesthetically to this group together with the adorante of berlin winckelmann antique favourite who with uplifted face and hand seem to be indeed in prayer look immaculate enough to be intercede for other as to the jason of the louvre one ask at first sight of he as he stoop to make fast the sandal on his foot whether the young man can be already so mark a personage be he already the approve hero bent on some great act of his famous epopée or mere youth only again array itself mechanically but alert in eye and soul prompt to be rouse to any great action whatever the vaguely open lip certainly suggest the latter view if indeed the body and the head really belong to one another ah the more closely you consider the fragment of antiquity those stray letter of the old greek aesthetic alphabet the less positive will your conclusion become because less conclusive the datum regard artistic origin and purpose set here also however to the end that in a congruous atmosphere in a real perspective they may assume their full moral and aesthetic expression whatever of like spirit you may come upon in greek or any other work remember that in england also in oxford we have still for any master of such art that may be give we subject truly as with these so with their prototype at olympia or at the isthmus above all perhaps in the diadumenus of polycleitus a certain melancholy be blent with the final impression we retain of they they be at play indeed in the sun but a little cloud pass over it now and then and just because of they because they be there the whole aspect of the place be chill suddenly beyond what one could have think possible into what seem nevertheless to be the proper and permanent light of day for though they pass on from age to age the type of what be pleasantest to look on which as type be indeed eternal it be of course but for an hour that it rest with any one of they individually assuredly they have no malady of soul any more than of the bodyanimi sensus non expressit but if they be not yet think there be the capacity of thought of painful thought in they as they seem to be aware wistfully in the diadumenus of polycleitus this expression ally itself to the longdrawn facial type of his preference to be find also in another very different subject the ideal of which he fix in greek sculpturethe wouldbe virile amazon in exquisite pain alike of body and soulthe we may be remind that in the first mention of athletic contest in greek literaturein the twentythird book of the iliadthey form part of the funeral rite of the hero patroclus it be thus though but in the faint degree even with the veritable prince of that world of antique bronze and marble the discobolus at rest of the vatican which might well be set where winckelmann set the adorante represent as it probably do the original of alcamene in whom a generation after pheidia an early and more earnest spirit still survive although the crisply trim head may seem a little too small to our perhaps not quite rightful eye we might accept he for that canon or measure of the perfect human form which polycleitus have propose he be neither the victor at rest as with polycleitus nor the combatant already in motion as with myron but as if step backward from myron precise point ofinter and with the heavydiscusstill in the left hand he be prepare for his venture take stand carefully on the right foot eye and mind concentre loyally entirely upon the business in hand the very finger be reckon while he watch intent upon the cast of another as the metal glide to the goal take he to lead you forth quite out of the narrow limit of the greek world you have pure humanity there with a glowing yet restrain joy and delight in itself but without vanity and it be pure there be nothing certainly supersensual in that fair round head any more than in the long agile limb but also no impediment natural or acquire to have achieve just that be the greek truest claim for furtherance in the main line of human development he have be faithful we can not help say as we pass from that youthful company in what comparatively be perhaps littlein the culture the administration of the visible world and he merit so we might go on to sayhe merit revelation
